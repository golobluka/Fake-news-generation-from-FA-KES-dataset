      "Original article:  Tuesday 04 April 2017 Syrian Coalition Calls for Holding Assad Regime Accountable for Repeated Chemical Attacks. The Syrian Coalition called on the UN Security Council to hold the Assad regime accountable for the horrific crime his forces committed in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the rural Idlib at dawn today. Chemical substances were used in the attack which left at least 100 people killed and over 400 wounded mostly women and children according to the directorate of health in Idlib province. In a press release issued on Tuesday the Coalition said that early photos and videos of the aftermath of the attack clearly show a horrible crime similar to the one the Assad regime committed in eastern Ghouta near Damascus in the summer of 2013 which the international community allowed to go unpunished. The Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to hold an emergency session to address this crime and conduct an immediate investigation into it. Urgent measures need to be taken to ensure that those who ordered executed supported and are involved in the attack are held accountable under Chapter VII of the UN Charter the Coalition said. The failure to take concrete urgent action would be understood by the Assad regime as a blessing for its actions. Inaction is no more an option as it amounts to direct involvement and even direct responsibility for those crimes the Coalition added. The Assad regimes air force also carried out a massacre against civilians in the town of Douma in eastern Ghouta on Monday claiming the lives of at least 32 people including women and children. The Assad regime continues to use internationally prohibited weapons in bombing civilian areas in a blatant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and UN Security Council resolutions 2118 2209 2235 and 2254. These crimes would not have happened again had it not been for the lukewarm response by the international community and its failure to ensure protection for civilians the Coalition said. The Coalition called for the implementation of Article 21 of UN Security Council resolution 2118 which says the Council would take measures under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter in case of noncompliance including the transfer and use of chemical weapons.

Dali added that the wounded were transferred to a hospital in the city to receive treatment. Civil defence and ambulance teams took several hours to retrieve dead bodies from under the rubble of the destroyed homes according to Dali. \"The city suffers from a lack of equipment to remove rubble and the regime prevented the entry of any materials into the city for around two years\" Dali said. \"The city hospital is also suffering from a shortage of medicine and supplies\" he said saying that medical aid was removed from humanitarian convoys before they entered the city.

The attack was the second time in less than a year that a bombing takes out the leadership of Ahrar al-Sham (\"Free men of the Levant\") one of the most powerful Islamic groups fighting both President Bashar Assads forces and its rival the Islamic State group which holds wide swaths of territory in Syria and Iraq. Tuesdays attack struck the headquarters of Ahrar al-Sham northwest of the town of Idlib killing the groups leader Abu Abdelrahman Salqeen. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said six other Ahrar al-Sham members also died. The Local Coordination Committees and other activists also reported the attack. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing. \\t \\t The attack came a few days after a senior member of Ahrar al-Sham published an op-ed piece in the Washington Post in which he denied espousing al-Qaedas ideology and portrayed his group as the moderate Islamist alternative in Syria claiming it was a key to defeating the IS. In September Ahrar al-Shams leader Hassan Abboud was killed along with several other leading members of the group in a similar bombing also in Idlib province. Ahrar al-Sham is the largest group in the Jaysh al-Fateh (Army of Conquest) the coalition of Islamist and moderate rebel groups that took control of the regime-held stronghold of Idlib in March this year. According to a report in al-Monitor the various groups in Jaysh al-Fateh are having trouble agreeing on a unified approach to governing the territory they have captured. The other large group in the coalition the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front reportedly attacked Sharia court buildings and police stations affiliated with Ahrar al-Sham-dominated Sharia authority for managing the liberated areas in Idlib in Kafr Nabl on 8 July. \\t \\tSyrian forces backed by Lebanese Hezbollah fighters have entered a rebel-held mountain resort near the border with Lebanon. This follows protests in the Idlib countryside against the Nusra Front which Nusra fighters suppressed reportedly with the use of lethal force and a bomb at a mosque last Friday in which killed at least 10 members of the group according to Reuters. UN envoy meets southern rebels UN Special Envoy for the Syria Crisis Staffan de Mistura met with leaders of the Southern Front alliance in southern Syria on Tuesday for the first time according to Reuters. The Southern Front alliance controls a significant amount of territory between the capital Damascus and the southern border and has made a number of significant gains against regime forces over the last few months. De Mistura began an extensive round of meetings with parties directly or indirectly involved in the conflict in May with an eye to ending the brutal four-year civil war. According to his office he plans to finalise plans by the end of July to reach a political solution to the conflict. Regime offensive tightens grip on Zabadani State media says Syrian forces backed by Lebanese Hizbollah fighters have entered a rebel-held mountain resort near the border with Lebanon a day after launching a major offensive to capture the town. State-run Syrian TV said troops entered the town of Zabadani from the western Jamaiyat district Sunday. Hezbollahs al-Manar TV ran exclusive footage purportedly showing Hezbollah fighters in the town. It showed scenes of heavy fighting including explosions and mushrooms of white smoke. According to other sources the regimes latest attempt to secure Zabadani started 12 days ago. \\t \\tMeshaal killed in an airstrike in Hasakeh composed several Jihadi hymns for the IS celebrating martyrdom and holy war. Regime warplanes and helicopters launched at least 60 air raids yesterday on the rebel-held Syrian town of Zabadani to the west of Damascus and a short distance from the Lebanese border according to a monitoring group. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said there had been at least 29 raids by warplanes on Zabadani and at least 34 barrel bombs dropped by helicopters so far today. The raids come as forces from the regimes army and Hezbollah are engaged in their 11th day of heavy fighting with rebel forces in the area for control of the strategic town. A spokesperson for the Zabadani Revolution Coordination Committee told al-Araby al-Jadeed on Monday that forces from the regimes army and Hezbollah had made several attempts to advance into the town from the south but all of these attempts had been repelled. Zabadanis capture would tighten Hezbollahs grip on Syrian territories bordering Lebanon and strengthen the Syrian governments control over of the Beirut-Damascus highway. The town has been held by rebels since shortly after Syrias crisis began in March 2011.

      "Article:  15 July 2015 Abu Abdelrahman Salqeen leader of Syrian rebel group Ahrar al-Sham was killed Tuesday in a suicide bombing that targeted the group for the second time in less than a year. Tags Syria Ahrar al-Sham Nusra Front suicide bombing Staffan De Mistura Southern Front alliance regime forces Hezbollah Zabadani Islamic State group airstrikes A double suicide bombing in northern Syria on Tuesday targeted the headquarters of an Islamist rebel group killing its leader and several other high ranking members. The attack was the second time in less than a year that a bombing takes out the leadership of Ahrar al-Sham (\"Free men of the Levant\") one of the most powerful Islamic groups fighting both President Bashar Assads forces and its rival the Islamic State group which holds wide swaths of territory in Syria and Iraq. Tuesdays attack struck the headquarters of Ahrar al-Sham northwest of the town of Idlib killing the groups leader Abu Abdelrahman Salqeen. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said six other Ahrar al-Sham members also died. The Local Coordination Committees and other activists also reported the attack. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing. \t \t The attack came a few days after a senior member of Ahrar al-Sham published an op-ed piece in the Washington Post in which he denied espousing al-Qaedas ideology and portrayed his group as the moderate Islamist alternative in Syria claiming it was a key to defeating the IS. In September Ahrar al-Shams leader Hassan Abboud was killed along with several other leading members of the group in a similar bombing also in Idlib province. Ahrar al-Sham is the largest group in the Jaysh al-Fateh (Army of Conquest) the coalition of Islamist and moderate rebel groups that took control of the regime-held stronghold of Idlib in March this year. According to a report in al-Monitor the various groups in Jaysh al-Fateh are having trouble agreeing on a unified approach to governing the territory they have captured. The other large group in the coalition the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front reportedly attacked Sharia court buildings and police stations affiliated with Ahrar al-Sham-dominated Sharia authority for managing the liberated areas in Idlib in Kafr Nabl on 8 July. \t \tSyrian forces backed by Lebanese Hezbollah fighters have entered a rebel-held mountain resort near the border with Lebanon. This follows protests in the Idlib countryside against the Nusra Front which Nusra fighters suppressed reportedly with the use of lethal force and a bomb at a mosque last Friday in which killed at least 10 members of the group according to Reuters. UN envoy meets southern rebels UN Special Envoy for the Syria Crisis Staffan de Mistura met with leaders of the Southern Front alliance in southern Syria on Tuesday for the first time according to Reuters. The Southern Front alliance controls a significant amount of territory between the capital Damascus and the southern border and has made a number of significant gains against regime forces over the last few months. De Mistura began an extensive round of meetings with parties directly or indirectly involved in the conflict in May with an eye to ending the brutal four-year civil war. According to his office he plans to finalise plans by the end of July to reach a political solution to the conflict. Regime offensive tightens grip on Zabadani State media says Syrian forces backed by Lebanese Hizbollah fighters have entered a rebel-held mountain resort near the border with Lebanon a day after launching a major offensive to capture the town. State-run Syrian TV said troops entered the town of Zabadani from the western Jamaiyat district Sunday. Hezbollahs al-Manar TV ran exclusive footage purportedly showing Hezbollah fighters in the town. It showed scenes of heavy fighting including explosions and mushrooms of white smoke. According to other sources the regimes latest attempt to secure Zabadani started 12 days ago. \t \tMeshaal killed in an airstrike in Hasakeh composed several Jihadi hymns for the IS celebrating martyrdom and holy war. Regime warplanes and helicopters launched at least 60 air raids yesterday on the rebel-held Syrian town of Zabadani to the west of Damascus and a short distance from the Lebanese border according to a monitoring group. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said there had been at least 29 raids by warplanes on Zabadani and at least 34 barrel bombs dropped by helicopters so far today. The raids come as forces from the regimes army and Hezbollah are engaged in their 11th day of heavy fighting with rebel forces in the area for control of the strategic town. A spokesperson for the Zabadani Revolution Coordination Committee told al-Araby al-Jadeed on Monday that forces from the regimes army and Hezbollah had made several attempts to advance into the town from the south but all of these attempts had been repelled. Zabadanis capture would tighten Hezbollahs grip on Syrian territories bordering Lebanon and strengthen the Syrian governments control over of the Beirut-Damascus highway. The town has been held by rebels since shortly after Syrias crisis began in March 2011. US airstrikes target the IS The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported the death of two senior Islamic State group (IS) leaders in a suspected US airstrike on Monday. Abu Osama al-Iraqi and Amer al-Rafdan were killed in what is believed to have been US airstrikes in Hasakeh. A Saudi national Maher Meshaal known as Abu Hajar al-Hadrami was also killed in airstrikes in Hasakeh according to IS supporters on twitter CBS reported. Meshaal composed several Jihadi hymns for the IS celebrating martyrdom and holy war. The airstrikes come a week after President Barrack Obama announced the US would intensify its campaign of airstrikes against the IS in northern Syria.\n",

Turkish shelling and air strikes killed at least 20 civilians in Syria on Sunday the fifth day of an incursion allegedly against the Takfiri ISIL group. Turkish shelling and air strikes killed at least 20 civilians in Syria on Sunday the fifth day of an incursion allegedly against the Takfiri ISIL group. \"At least 20 civilians were killed and 50 others wounded by Turkish artillery fire and air strikes on Sunday morning at Jeb el-Kussa\" a village south of Jarabulus said Rami Abdel Rahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. It comes after Turkey on Saturday suffered its first fatality since launching operation \"Euphrates Shield\" in Syria blaming Kurdish militia in a fight for control of the border region. The Britain-based Observatory said the bombardment targeted an area south of the former ISIL group stronghold of Jarabulus which Turkish-led forces captured on the first day of the incursion. Jeb el-Kussa is located 14 kilometers (almost nine miles) south of Jarabulus and is controlled by fighters from the area backed by Kurdish forces. Some of the fighters were killed in Sundays shelling and air strikes but the number was not yet clear said the Observatory a Britain-based monitor with a network of sources on the ground. On Saturday clashes erupted for the first time between Turkish forces backed by tanks and pro-Kurdish fighters in the town of Al-Amarneh also south of Jarabulus. \n",

      "Article:  Wed Jun 1 2016 15 Syrian Civilians 3 Children Killed in Aleppo by US Airstrikes Report. At least 15 civilians including three children have been killed in northern Syria in US airstrikes purportedly targeting ISIS positions in the Arab country a report says. The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said Wednesday that the attacks had occurred in the city of Manbij in Aleppo Province during the past 24 hours. The airstrikes came a day after the White house said the US government was following up on press reports about alleged Russian airstrikes in Syria with civilian casualties. The observatory and the Reuters news agency said on Tuesday that at least 23 people had been killed in Russian airstrikes in the militant-held city of Idlib including one near a hospital. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Major General Igor Konashenkov denied the reports. We urge people to remain critical of any horror stories spread by the British tandem of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and Reuters news agency he said. Elsewhere in northern Syria thousands of troops from a Kurdish-Arab alliance are launching an attack to capture from Daesh a crucial swathe of the region known as the Manbij pocket following weeks of quiet preparations US officials told Reuters. The Pentagon has reportedly deployed more than 200 special forces troops alongside the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) a coalition of Kurdish Arab Assyrian Armenian and Turkmen fighters. The Observatory said that the forces captured16 villages from Daesh and advanced to within nine miles on Manbij. Meanwhile Turkish military forces shelled northern Syria claiming to have targeted positions of the ISIS Takfiri terrorist group in the war-torn Arab country. The Turkish General Staff said in a statement on Wednesday that at least 14 members of the terrorist group were killed during the shelling on the city of Aleppo. The state-run Anadolu Agency citing military officials said Wednesday the strikes destroyed a tank two mortar positions a building used as headquarters and three vehicles belonging to the terrorists. The report which could not be independently verified said the air raids came after Turkeys military had determined that Daesh militants were preparing to attack the Turkish territory from the region. Cross-border fire from Syria has claimed 21 lives and wounded dozens of others in the border town of Kilis south central Turkey this year. Turkey itself stands accused of supporting Takfiri militants in Syria. Al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front and other Takfiri terrorists hold most of the northwestern province of Idlib and parts of neighboring Aleppo province. On Sunday Associated Press said Nusra Front has used a March ceasefire to recruit thousands of militants including teenagers who had used the Turkish border to slip into Syria. It is illustrating how the ceasefire put in place by Russia and the United States to weaken the militants has in many ways backfired the news agency said. Since March Nusra Front has recruited 3000 new militants including teenagers in comparison to an average of 200 to 300 a month before AP quoted SOHR as saying. Other sources said hundreds living in camps for displaced people in the northern parts near Turkey have joined the al-Qaeda branch Press TV reported. 212\n",

      "Article:  Sun Aug 17 2014 ISIL kills 700 people from Syrian tribe. The so-called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) militant group has executed 700 members of a tribe it has been battling in eastern Syria during the past two weeks the majority of them civilians a human rights monitoring group says. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which has tracked violence on all sides of the three-year-old conflict said on Saturday that reliable sources reported beheadings were used to execute many of the al-Sheitaat tribe which is from Deir al-Zour province. The conflict between ISIL and the al-Sheitaat tribe who number about 70000 flared after the militants took over two oil fields in July. Those who were executed are all al-Sheitaat Observatory director Rami Abdel-Rahman said by telephone from Britain. Some were arrested judged and killed. Straddling parts of Iraq and Syria ISIL has swept across northern Iraq in recent weeks pushing back Kurdish regional forces and driving tens of thousands of Muslims Christians and members of the Yazidi religious minority from their homes. The insurgents are also tightening their grip in parts of Syria of which they now control roughly a third mostly rural areas in the north and east. An activist in Deir al-Zour who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters that 300 men were executed in one day in the town of Ghraneij one of the three main towns of the al-Sheitaat tribal heartland when ISIL stormed the town earlier this week. Another opposition activist from Deir al-Zour said residents of al-Sheitaat towns had been given three days to leave. Civilians fleeing al-Sheitaat towns had either taken sanctuary in other villages or travelled to Iraq he said. More than 170000 people have been reportedly killed in Syrias conflict which pits overwhelmingly Takfiri militants against the Syrian government since March 2011. NTJHH\n",

The Syrian opposition has accused government forces of carrying out a deadly gas attack on residents of the Duma neighbourhood, possibly up to 1300 people, in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The government has denied using chemical weapons. French and British officials have expressed outrage at the alleged attack, comparing it to a similar tragedy that occurred in Iraq in 1988 when thousands of Kurds were killed by Saddam Hussein's forces.\n",
