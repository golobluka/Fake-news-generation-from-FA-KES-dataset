144,"Chemical weapons attack in Syria's Homs kills 10: Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) report AFP Sunday, May 25, 2014. Ten people were killed and 22 wounded in a chemical weapons attack on a collective taxi stand in Zahraa, a district inhabited by Alawites, said Talal al-Barazi. Barazi had earlier reported a toll of eight while the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights gave a death toll of 12. A second chemical weapons attack exploded in another district of the city wounding three people but without causing more deaths said Barazi. Homs has seen some of the worst violence in Syria's more than three-year-old civil war. For almost two years anti-regime fighters and local residents were trapped in a suffocating army siege of the Old City in the heart of Homs. They were evacuated earlier this month under an unprecedented deal involving a major rebel coalition and Iran, a strong backer of the regime. The end of the Old City siege brought it back under regime control leaving only the Waer district in northwest Homs in rebel hands. The Observatory and activists say a deal is being negotiated for a truce in Waer which is home to hundreds of thousands of civilians.

Russian forces, however, deny any involvement in the chemical weapons attack. The Syrian government has blamed the incident on rebels, but no concrete evidence was provided to support this claim. The investigation into the attack is still ongoing, and it remains unclear who was responsible for the tragic event that left 10 people dead and 22 wounded.","{'Name of casualty or group': 'Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF)', 'Gender or age group': 'No information on gender or age group of casualties.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said militants sneaked into the village of Rajm Sleibi which houses the camp for the displaced people fleeing Daesh-held areas in Syria and Iraq. The village lies in Hasakeh province a frontline that separates the area from Daesh-held places further south. ""At least five suicide attackers blew themselves up outside and inside a camp for Iraqi refugees and displaced Syrians in Hasakeh province"" Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. The dead included displaced children. Heavy clashes then erupted between the Daesh fighters and members of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters some of whose combatants were among the dead Abdel Rahman said. The SDF is dominated by the YPG which is the armed wing of the PYD a Syrian affiliate of the PKK listed as a terrorist organisation by Turkey the US and EU. Redur Khalil one of the spokespersons within SDF said the attack came a few hours after Daesh suicide bombers dressed in civilian clothes entered the town of Shaddadeh and engaged SDF forces triggering clashes. Daesh is under attack by an array of forces in Syria and Iraq. In Syria the SDF is now fighting to recapture the town of Tabqa from the group. Tabqa is an important stronghold for the militants located about 40 kilometres (25 miles) southeast of Daeshs de facto capital the city of Raqqa. In Iraq the extremist group is fighting for survival against Iraqi forces and their allies in the last neighbourhoods it still holds in the western part of Mosul Iraqs second largest city. Chemical attacks Human Rights Watch on Monday accused Syrian government forces of likely dropping bombs containing nerve agents at least three times elsewhere in the country before an April 4 attack that killed dozens of people and sparked a retaliatory US strike. Bashar al Assads forces are also stepping up chlorine gas attacks and have begun using surface-fired rockets filled with chlorine in fighting near Damascus the US-based rights group said in a new report. ""The governments use of nerve agents is a deadly escalation and part of a clear pattern"" said Kenneth Roth Human Rights Watchs executive director. ""In the last six months the government has used warplanes helicopters and ground forces to deliver chlorine and sarin in Damascus Hama Idlib and Aleppo."" The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical weapons a global watchdog has said sarin or a similar banned toxin was used in the April 4 strike. Human Rights Watch said that before the April 4 attack on Khan Shaykhun government warplanes also appeared to have dropped nerve agents on eastern Hama on December 11 and 12 2016 and northern Hama near Khan Shaykhun on March 30 2017. Three suspected attacks in Hama Human Rights Watch said 64 people died from exposure to nerve agents after warplanes attacked territory controlled by Daesh in eastern Hama on December 11 and December 12. Activists and local residents provided names of the victims while Human Rights Watch interviewed four witnesses and two medical personnel about the alleged attacks. A third suspected nerve agent attack in northern Hama on March 30 caused no deaths but injured dozens of civilians and combatants according to residents and medical personnel the report said. The alleged attacks were systematic and in some cases directed against civilians which would meet the legal criteria to be characterised as crimes against humanity the rights group said. Syrian regime denies accusations The Syrian regime has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons. The Syrian UN mission was not immediately available to comment on the allegations by Human Rights Watch which cited interviews with witnesses and medical personnel. Last month Assad told AFP in an interview that the suspected sarin attack in Khan Shaykhun was ""100 percent"" fabricated serving as a pretext for US missile strikes on a Syrian airfield.

263,Tuesday 04 April 2017 Syrian Coalition Calls for Holding Russian Forces Accountable for Repeated Shelling Attacks. The Syrian Coalition called on the UN Security Council to hold the Russian forces accountable for the horrific crime they committed in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the rural Idlib at dawn today. Shelling by artillery was used in the attack which left at least 100 Kurdish Female Fighters (YPJ) killed and over 400 wounded mostly women and children according to the directorate of health in Idlib province. In a press release issued on Tuesday the Coalition said that early photos and videos of the aftermath of the attack clearly show a horrible crime similar to the one the Russian forces committed in eastern Ghouta near Damascus in the summer of 2013 which the international community allowed to go unpunished. The Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to hold an emergency session to address this crime and conduct an immediate investigation into it. Urgent measures need to be taken to ensure that those who ordered executed supported and are involved in the attack are held accountable under Chapter VII of the UN Charter the Coalition said. The failure to take concrete urgent action would be understood by the Russian forces as a blessing for their actions. Inaction is no more an option as it amounts to direct involvement and even direct responsibility for those crimes the Coalition added. The Russian forces air force also carried out a massacre against civilians in the town of Douma in eastern Ghouta on Monday claiming the lives of at least 32 people including women and children. The Russian forces continue to use internationally prohibited weapons in bombing civilian areas in a blatant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and UN Security Council resolutions 2118 2209 2235 and 2254. These crimes would not have happened again had it not been for the lukewarm response by the international community and its failure to ensure protection for civilians the Coalition said.

The air strikes which began Saturday and continued Sunday killed 45 civilians in and around Aleppo and 22 in neighbouring Idlib province the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The raids came as the Faylaq Al Sham Islamist faction part of the rebel alliance said it had begun a new offensive to liberate the regime-held district of Zahra on Aleppos western outskirts. The Britain-based observatory and opposition fighters said a car bomb exploded in Zahra Sunday but did not mention casualties. The monitor said the air strikes targeted areas held by the Army of Conquest an alliance of rebel Islamist and militant forces that has mounted a major Aleppo offensive. The intensification of the strikes in Idlib is due to the fact that this province is the main source of fighters for the Army of Conquest said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. An AFP correspondent in rebel-held eastern Aleppo said the strikes were especially intense around the southern district of Ramussa seized by rebels earlier this month in a major setback for forces loyal to President Bashar Assad. Nine other civilians were killed in rebel shelling of regime-held western Aleppo Saturday the observatory said. Aleppo Syrias former economic hub and a focal point of its five-year civil war has been divided between a rebel-held east and regime-controlled west since mid-2012. Intensifying battle Fighting for the city has intensified after regime troops seized control of the last supply route into rebel-held areas in mid-July. After a nearly three-week siege rebels took Ramussa on August 6 linking up with opposition-held neighbourhoods. Emboldened by the success the Army of Conquest announced an ambitious bid to capture all of Aleppo which if successful would be the biggest opposition victory yet in Syrias conflict. Alliance fighters late Sunday began an assault southeast of Ramussa on an area containing a former cement plant turned into an army barracks where a large amount of weapons and military vehicles are stored the observatory said. The rebels want to secure the supply line they opened last week into rebel districts Abdel Rahman said. The increased fighting has raised concerns for the estimated 1.5 million civilians still in Aleppo including some 250000 in rebel-held areas. The United Nations has called for regular 48-hour pauses in the fighting to allow aid into the city which has suffered from severe shortages of food water and medical supplies. Russia began air strikes last September in support of Assad helping the regime to consolidate its hold on loyal areas and regain some territory. The defence ministry in Moscow said on Sunday six long-range bombers from Russia had struck around Deir Ezzor a stronghold of the Daesh terror group. Daesh controls large parts of Deir Ezzor city and most of the oil-rich eastern province of the same name part of the swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq that it seized in mid-2014. Girl evacuated The ministry said the Russian Tupolev bombers carried out raids southwest east and northeast of the city wiping out two command posts six arms depots IS vehicles and a large number of fighters. Daesh emerged amid the chaos of Syrias conflict a complex and multi-front war that has killed more than 290000 and displaced millions since beginning with anti-regime protests in March 2011. A US-led coalition is also battling Daesh in Syria and Iraq with air strikes and backing for the Syrian Democratic Forces an Arab-Kurdish militia alliance which on Friday took full control of the strategic city of Manbij after Daesh retreated. The extremists took some 2000 civilians as they fled to serve as human shields. Hundreds were released on Saturday but the SDF said the fate of many remained unclear. On Sunday the SDF said they had established a military council to push Daesh militants out of Al Bab the alliances next target in the same province. In rare good news a 10-year-old girl shot in the besieged town of Madaya was evacuated to a Damascus hospital where she was in a stable condition the observatory and a security source said.

More than 100 Takfiri terrorists have been killed in two days of air and ground operations by the Syrian military across the Arab country. Syrias official news agency SANA reported on Wednesday that Syrian fighter jets targeted hideouts of the Takfiri Daesh terrorists in the town of al-Bab and several other villages in the northeastern countryside of Aleppo Province. The report said at least 70 terrorists were slain. The Syrian aircraft also dealt a heavy blow to the Takfiri militants in airstrikes on their command posts in Eastern Ghouta on the outskirts of the capital Damascus. The Syrian forces recently regained control of several areas in the same region. Also on Wednesday airstrikes by the Syrian air force targeted gathering centers of militants of the Jaish al-Fatah in Kafr Zita Jub al-Rayan and Kafr Nabudah in the northern countryside of Hama. Jaish al-Fateh terrorists suffered another blow in similar strikes on their hideouts in the province of Idlib. On Tuesday at least six Takfiri militants were killed in attacks by the Syrian ground forces in the provinces of Hama and Idlib. Separately the Syrian army released footage showing the operation of liberating two strategic villages in Aleppo. The villages of Masqan and Ehras in the northern countryside of Aleppo were liberated from the control of the Takfiri militants on Monday. The army backed by popular forces also won back the village of al-Tiba in the eastern countryside of Aleppo as well as Kafar Naya 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of Aleppo City. The Syrian army and its allies backed by Russian warplanes have recently made major advances against Takfiri militants north of Aleppo. Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi said on February 10 that the government forces will soon take full control of the militant-held areas of Aleppo but predicted a tough battle for the largest city in the Arab country. ""These battles are not easy but the day will come God willing when all Aleppo - its rural areas and the occupied part of the city - will return to state authority"" Zoubi said. Syria has been gripped by foreign-backed militancy since March 2011. According to a new report by the Syrian Center for Policy Research the conflict has claimed the lives of over 470000 people injured 1.9 million others and displaced nearly half of the countrys pre-war population of about 23 million within or beyond its borders Press TV reported.

At least 412 people more than half of them from ISIS have been killed in and around Kobane since mid-September the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. It warned that the inaccessibility of the area meant that the full toll was probably much higher. With the fight for Kobane entering a crucial phase the IS militants fought to extend their foothold into new areas in the south and west of the town a day after piercing its Kurdish defenses. Gunfire explosions and the roar of fighter jets were heard from the Turkish side of the border while a Kurdish flag was seen flying in the centre of Kobane according to an AFP journalist. The IS Terrorists ""are trying hard to capture the city"" said Idris Nahsen a Kurdish official still in Kobane also known as Ain al-Arab. He said they were meeting resistance from the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units. ""We need help from the international community"" Nahsen told AFP by telephone. ""Either we finish them (IS) or they will finish us."" IS fighters have seized a number of buildings in south and west Kobane including a hospital under construction according to the Observatory a Britain-based monitoring group. Kurdish fighters have ordered civilians to evacuate the town after the Terrorists planted their black flags on its eastern side and entered Kobane on Monday. In Iraq meanwhile at least 17 people were reported killed when a suicide bomber attacked an observation post used by Shiite militiamen watching for IS fighters crossing the Tigris River late Monday. The United States and its allies have launched nearly 2000 air raids against ISIS in both Iraq and Syria in an attempt to stop their advance including four strikes in Kobane on Tuesday. The Kurdish fighters are optimistic that their local knowledge of Kobane will compensate for their light weapons said activist Mustafa Ebdi. ""They are fighting to defend their town and they say they will fight to the last person"" he said.Ebdi added the latest US air raids had little effect. ""The strikes hit the Mishtenur area"" he said referring to a plateau south of Kobane.""But they (IS) arent gathered there. There are other places they should be hitting"" he said. The raging battle has prompted some 186000 residents to flee across the Turkish border. An official in the Turkish town of Suruc said on Tuesday that 700 people including 47 wounded had crossed the border from Syria overnight both civilians and Kurdish combatants.
