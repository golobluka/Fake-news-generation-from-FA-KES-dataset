144,"Chemical weapons attack in Syria's Homs kills 10: Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) report AFP Sunday, May 25, 2014. Ten people were killed and 22 wounded in a chemical weapons attack on a collective taxi stand in Zahraa, a district inhabited by Alawites, said Talal al-Barazi. Barazi had earlier reported a toll of eight while the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights gave a death toll of 12. A second chemical weapons attack exploded in another district of the city wounding three people but without causing more deaths said Barazi. Homs has seen some of the worst violence in Syria's more than three-year-old civil war. For almost two years anti-regime fighters and local residents were trapped in a suffocating army siege of the Old City in the heart of Homs. They were evacuated earlier this month under an unprecedented deal involving a major rebel coalition and Iran, a strong backer of the regime. The end of the Old City siege brought it back under regime control leaving only the Waer district in northwest Homs in rebel hands. The Observatory and activists say a deal is being negotiated for a truce in Waer which is home to hundreds of thousands of civilians.

Russian forces, however, deny any involvement in the chemical weapons attack. The Syrian government has blamed the incident on rebels, but no concrete evidence was provided to support this claim. The investigation into the attack is still ongoing, and it remains unclear who was responsible for the tragic event that left 10 people dead and 22 wounded.","{'Name of casualty or group': 'Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF)', 'Gender or age group': 'No information on gender or age group of casualties.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said militants sneaked into the village of Rajm Sleibi which houses the camp for the displaced people fleeing Daesh-held areas in Syria and Iraq. The village lies in Hasakeh province a frontline that separates the area from Daesh-held places further south. ""At least five suicide attackers blew themselves up outside and inside a camp for Iraqi refugees and displaced Syrians in Hasakeh province"" Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. The dead included displaced children. Heavy clashes then erupted between the Daesh fighters and members of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters some of whose combatants were among the dead Abdel Rahman said. The SDF is dominated by the YPG which is the armed wing of the PYD a Syrian affiliate of the PKK listed as a terrorist organisation by Turkey the US and EU. Redur Khalil one of the spokespersons within SDF said the attack came a few hours after Daesh suicide bombers dressed in civilian clothes entered the town of Shaddadeh and engaged SDF forces triggering clashes. Daesh is under attack by an array of forces in Syria and Iraq. In Syria the SDF is now fighting to recapture the town of Tabqa from the group. Tabqa is an important stronghold for the militants located about 40 kilometres (25 miles) southeast of Daeshs de facto capital the city of Raqqa. In Iraq the extremist group is fighting for survival against Iraqi forces and their allies in the last neighbourhoods it still holds in the western part of Mosul Iraqs second largest city. Chemical attacks Human Rights Watch on Monday accused Syrian government forces of likely dropping bombs containing nerve agents at least three times elsewhere in the country before an April 4 attack that killed dozens of people and sparked a retaliatory US strike. Bashar al Assads forces are also stepping up chlorine gas attacks and have begun using surface-fired rockets filled with chlorine in fighting near Damascus the US-based rights group said in a new report. ""The governments use of nerve agents is a deadly escalation and part of a clear pattern"" said Kenneth Roth Human Rights Watchs executive director. ""In the last six months the government has used warplanes helicopters and ground forces to deliver chlorine and sarin in Damascus Hama Idlib and Aleppo."" The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical weapons a global watchdog has said sarin or a similar banned toxin was used in the April 4 strike. Human Rights Watch said that before the April 4 attack on Khan Shaykhun government warplanes also appeared to have dropped nerve agents on eastern Hama on December 11 and 12 2016 and northern Hama near Khan Shaykhun on March 30 2017. Three suspected attacks in Hama Human Rights Watch said 64 people died from exposure to nerve agents after warplanes attacked territory controlled by Daesh in eastern Hama on December 11 and December 12. Activists and local residents provided names of the victims while Human Rights Watch interviewed four witnesses and two medical personnel about the alleged attacks. A third suspected nerve agent attack in northern Hama on March 30 caused no deaths but injured dozens of civilians and combatants according to residents and medical personnel the report said. The alleged attacks were systematic and in some cases directed against civilians which would meet the legal criteria to be characterised as crimes against humanity the rights group said. Syrian regime denies accusations The Syrian regime has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons. The Syrian UN mission was not immediately available to comment on the allegations by Human Rights Watch which cited interviews with witnesses and medical personnel. Last month Assad told AFP in an interview that the suspected sarin attack in Khan Shaykhun was ""100 percent"" fabricated serving as a pretext for US missile strikes on a Syrian airfield.

263,Tuesday 04 April 2017 Syrian Coalition Calls for Holding Russian Forces Accountable for Repeated Shelling Attacks. The Syrian Coalition called on the UN Security Council to hold the Russian forces accountable for the horrific crime they committed in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the rural Idlib at dawn today. Shelling by artillery was used in the attack which left at least 100 Kurdish Female Fighters (YPJ) killed and over 400 wounded mostly women and children according to the directorate of health in Idlib province. In a press release issued on Tuesday the Coalition said that early photos and videos of the aftermath of the attack clearly show a horrible crime similar to the one the Russian forces committed in eastern Ghouta near Damascus in the summer of 2013 which the international community allowed to go unpunished. The Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to hold an emergency session to address this crime and conduct an immediate investigation into it. Urgent measures need to be taken to ensure that those who ordered executed supported and are involved in the attack are held accountable under Chapter VII of the UN Charter the Coalition said. The failure to take concrete urgent action would be understood by the Russian forces as a blessing for their actions. Inaction is no more an option as it amounts to direct involvement and even direct responsibility for those crimes the Coalition added. The Russian forces air force also carried out a massacre against civilians in the town of Douma in eastern Ghouta on Monday claiming the lives of at least 32 people including women and children. The Russian forces continue to use internationally prohibited weapons in bombing civilian areas in a blatant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and UN Security Council resolutions 2118 2209 2235 and 2254. These crimes would not have happened again had it not been for the lukewarm response by the international community and its failure to ensure protection for civilians the Coalition said.

The air strikes which began Saturday and continued Sunday killed 45 civilians in and around Aleppo and 22 in neighbouring Idlib province the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The raids came as the Faylaq Al Sham Islamist faction part of the rebel alliance said it had begun a new offensive to liberate the regime-held district of Zahra on Aleppos western outskirts. The Britain-based observatory and opposition fighters said a car bomb exploded in Zahra Sunday but did not mention casualties. The monitor said the air strikes targeted areas held by the Army of Conquest an alliance of rebel Islamist and militant forces that has mounted a major Aleppo offensive. The intensification of the strikes in Idlib is due to the fact that this province is the main source of fighters for the Army of Conquest said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. An AFP correspondent in rebel-held eastern Aleppo said the strikes were especially intense around the southern district of Ramussa seized by rebels earlier this month in a major setback for forces loyal to President Bashar Assad. Nine other civilians were killed in rebel shelling of regime-held western Aleppo Saturday the observatory said. Aleppo Syrias former economic hub and a focal point of its five-year civil war has been divided between a rebel-held east and regime-controlled west since mid-2012. Intensifying battle Fighting for the city has intensified after regime troops seized control of the last supply route into rebel-held areas in mid-July. After a nearly three-week siege rebels took Ramussa on August 6 linking up with opposition-held neighbourhoods. Emboldened by the success the Army of Conquest announced an ambitious bid to capture all of Aleppo which if successful would be the biggest opposition victory yet in Syrias conflict. Alliance fighters late Sunday began an assault southeast of Ramussa on an area containing a former cement plant turned into an army barracks where a large amount of weapons and military vehicles are stored the observatory said. The rebels want to secure the supply line they opened last week into rebel districts Abdel Rahman said. The increased fighting has raised concerns for the estimated 1.5 million civilians still in Aleppo including some 250000 in rebel-held areas. The United Nations has called for regular 48-hour pauses in the fighting to allow aid into the city which has suffered from severe shortages of food water and medical supplies. Russia began air strikes last September in support of Assad helping the regime to consolidate its hold on loyal areas and regain some territory. The defence ministry in Moscow said on Sunday six long-range bombers from Russia had struck around Deir Ezzor a stronghold of the Daesh terror group. Daesh controls large parts of Deir Ezzor city and most of the oil-rich eastern province of the same name part of the swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq that it seized in mid-2014. Girl evacuated The ministry said the Russian Tupolev bombers carried out raids southwest east and northeast of the city wiping out two command posts six arms depots IS vehicles and a large number of fighters. Daesh emerged amid the chaos of Syrias conflict a complex and multi-front war that has killed more than 290000 and displaced millions since beginning with anti-regime protests in March 2011. A US-led coalition is also battling Daesh in Syria and Iraq with air strikes and backing for the Syrian Democratic Forces an Arab-Kurdish militia alliance which on Friday took full control of the strategic city of Manbij after Daesh retreated. The extremists took some 2000 civilians as they fled to serve as human shields. Hundreds were released on Saturday but the SDF said the fate of many remained unclear. On Sunday the SDF said they had established a military council to push Daesh militants out of Al Bab the alliances next target in the same province. In rare good news a 10-year-old girl shot in the besieged town of Madaya was evacuated to a Damascus hospital where she was in a stable condition the observatory and a security source said.

More than 100 Takfiri terrorists have been killed in two days of air and ground operations by the Syrian military across the Arab country. Syrias official news agency SANA reported on Wednesday that Syrian fighter jets targeted hideouts of the Takfiri Daesh terrorists in the town of al-Bab and several other villages in the northeastern countryside of Aleppo Province. The report said at least 70 terrorists were slain. The Syrian aircraft also dealt a heavy blow to the Takfiri militants in airstrikes on their command posts in Eastern Ghouta on the outskirts of the capital Damascus. The Syrian forces recently regained control of several areas in the same region. Also on Wednesday airstrikes by the Syrian air force targeted gathering centers of militants of the Jaish al-Fatah in Kafr Zita Jub al-Rayan and Kafr Nabudah in the northern countryside of Hama. Jaish al-Fateh terrorists suffered another blow in similar strikes on their hideouts in the province of Idlib. On Tuesday at least six Takfiri militants were killed in attacks by the Syrian ground forces in the provinces of Hama and Idlib. Separately the Syrian army released footage showing the operation of liberating two strategic villages in Aleppo. The villages of Masqan and Ehras in the northern countryside of Aleppo were liberated from the control of the Takfiri militants on Monday. The army backed by popular forces also won back the village of al-Tiba in the eastern countryside of Aleppo as well as Kafar Naya 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of Aleppo City. The Syrian army and its allies backed by Russian warplanes have recently made major advances against Takfiri militants north of Aleppo. Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi said on February 10 that the government forces will soon take full control of the militant-held areas of Aleppo but predicted a tough battle for the largest city in the Arab country. ""These battles are not easy but the day will come God willing when all Aleppo - its rural areas and the occupied part of the city - will return to state authority"" Zoubi said. Syria has been gripped by foreign-backed militancy since March 2011. According to a new report by the Syrian Center for Policy Research the conflict has claimed the lives of over 470000 people injured 1.9 million others and displaced nearly half of the countrys pre-war population of about 23 million within or beyond its borders Press TV reported.

At least 412 people more than half of them from ISIS have been killed in and around Kobane since mid-September the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. It warned that the inaccessibility of the area meant that the full toll was probably much higher. With the fight for Kobane entering a crucial phase the IS militants fought to extend their foothold into new areas in the south and west of the town a day after piercing its Kurdish defenses. Gunfire explosions and the roar of fighter jets were heard from the Turkish side of the border while a Kurdish flag was seen flying in the centre of Kobane according to an AFP journalist. The IS Terrorists ""are trying hard to capture the city"" said Idris Nahsen a Kurdish official still in Kobane also known as Ain al-Arab. He said they were meeting resistance from the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units. ""We need help from the international community"" Nahsen told AFP by telephone. ""Either we finish them (IS) or they will finish us."" IS fighters have seized a number of buildings in south and west Kobane including a hospital under construction according to the Observatory a Britain-based monitoring group. Kurdish fighters have ordered civilians to evacuate the town after the Terrorists planted their black flags on its eastern side and entered Kobane on Monday. In Iraq meanwhile at least 17 people were reported killed when a suicide bomber attacked an observation post used by Shiite militiamen watching for IS fighters crossing the Tigris River late Monday. The United States and its allies have launched nearly 2000 air raids against ISIS in both Iraq and Syria in an attempt to stop their advance including four strikes in Kobane on Tuesday. The Kurdish fighters are optimistic that their local knowledge of Kobane will compensate for their light weapons said activist Mustafa Ebdi. ""They are fighting to defend their town and they say they will fight to the last person"" he said.Ebdi added the latest US air raids had little effect. ""The strikes hit the Mishtenur area"" he said referring to a plateau south of Kobane.""But they (IS) arent gathered there. There are other places they should be hitting"" he said. The raging battle has prompted some 186000 residents to flee across the Turkish border. An official in the Turkish town of Suruc said on Tuesday that 700 people including 47 wounded had crossed the border from Syria overnight both civilians and Kurdish combatants.

(AP) As Trump stood by his charge that Assads forces were responsible Russia disagreed. The staunch Assad ally insisted that the chemicals were dispersed when Syrian warplanes bombed a facility where rebels were building chemical weapons. At the United Nations Trumps envoy threatened unilateral US action if the world body failed to act. When the United Nations consistently fails in its duty to act collectively there are times in the life of states that we are compelled to take our own action Haley declared. She addressed an emergency meeting of the Security Council which was weighing a resolution condemning chemical weapons use in Syria. Russia which has veto power is opposed. Yet in Moscow Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova focused her attention elsewhere: Its necessary to demand that the rebels offer full access to study the area and collect necessary information. Leaders and officials in other countries including Britain and Israel joined the US in saying Assads forces were responsible. A US official said an American review of radar and other assessments showed Syrian aircraft flying in the area at the time of the attack. Russian and coalition aircraft were not there at that time said the official who wasnt authorized to discuss intelligence publicly and requested anonymity. Washington hasnt yet concluded what type of chemical was used. On Tuesday President Donald Trump split the blame between Syrias embattled leader and former President Barack Obama for the countrys worst chemical weapons attack in years. While calling the attack reprehensible and intolerable Trump said Obama did nothing after Assad crossed the former US leaders red line in 2013. These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the past administrations weakness and irresolution Trump said. The political tone of Trumps statement took many US officials by surprise. They noted that US presidents have rarely attacked their predecessors so aggressively for events like chemical weapons attacks that Democrats and Republicans both abhor. Several officials involved in internal administration discussions said Trumps National Security Council had been preparing a different statement until the presidents closest advisers took over the process.

Syrian television broadcast footage showing people running away from a mushroom of gray smoke rising over the town and others running amid wrecked or burnt cars. Aleppo resident Suleiman Youssef a writer told The Associated Press by telephone that he heard the first shot from few miles away.

At least 1300 people have been killed in a nerve gas attack on Syrias Ghouta region leading opposition figure George Sabra said on Wednesday. In response the opposition Syrian National Coalition called for an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting on the subject. I call on the Security Council to convene urgently National Coalition leader Ahmed al-Jarba added to Al-Arabiya news channel condemning the Syrian armys bombardment of the Ghouta suburbs of Damascus as a massacre. Meanwhile The Arab League called Wednesday on U.N. chemical weapons inspectors now inside Syria to immediately visit the site of the incident. Arab League chief Nabil al-Arabi urged the inspectors in a statement to go immediately to Eastern Ghouta to see the reality of the situation and investigate the circumstances of this crime. Britain said on Wednesday it would raise a reported chemical weapons attack by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad at the United Nations Security Council and called on Damascus to give U.N. inspectors access to the site Reuters reported. I am deeply concerned by reports that hundreds of people including children have been killed in airstrikes and a chemical weapons attack on rebel-held areas near Damascus British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement. France also called for action by the U.N. during a cabinet session Hollande announced his intention to ask the U.N. to visit the site of the attack government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem told reporters on Wednesday. This information obviously requires verification and confirmation she added. Activists at the Syrian Revolutionary Command Council said regime fighter planes were flying over the area after the bombardment accusing the forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad of using chemical agents. The attack was on rebel-held areas of eastern Damascus. Regime forces ... stepped up military operations in the Eastern Ghouta and Western Ghouta zones of the Damascus region with aircraft and rocket launchers causing several dozen dead and wounded the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told AFP news agency. The intensive bombing on the outskirts of the capital could be heard by residents of Damascus where a grey cloud capped the sky. The Britain-based Observatory which relies on a vast network of activists on the ground and medics said the army operation was aimed at the recapture of Madhamiyat el-Sham an area southwest of Damascus. The Local Coordination Committees (LCC) a network of activists reported hundreds of casualties in the brutal use of toxic gas by the criminal regime in parts of Western Ghouta. According to Reuters news agency the reported use of the chemical agents could not be immediately verified. The news coincides with a visit to Damascus by a United Nations team of chemical weapons experts. In an interview with Al Arabiya Syrian National Coalition chief Ahmad Jarba called on the U.N. investigators to travel to Ghouta the site of the massacre. Activists from the grassroots Local Coordination Committee reported at least 30 bodies had been brought to one field hospital in Kafr Batna neighborhood a few miles east of central Damascus according to Reuters. Meanwhile the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said dozens of people were killed including children in fierce bombardment. Activists at the Local Coordinating Committees said Mouadamiya southwest of the capital came under the heaviest attack since the start of the two-year conflict. Regime denial Meanwhile Syrian authorities denied charges that the army used chemical weapons in the attacks. Reports on the use of chemical weapons in (the suburbs of) Ghouta are totally false state news agency SANA said. It dismissed as unfounded the reports from opposition activists and said satellite news channels carrying the reports are implicated in the shedding of Syrian blood and support terrorism.

It was the largest and deadliest attack to hit the city since the beginning of Syrias conflict in March 2011. Syrian state media gave a toll of 44 dead and 140 injured in the bombing which hit a western district of the city where several local Kurdish ministries are located. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor gave a toll of 48 dead adding that children and women were among those killed. Kurdish officials said the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber driving an explosives-laden truck adding that the blast detonated a nearby fuel container. An AFP journalist saw devastating scenes in the bombs aftermath with distraught civilians some covered in blood staggering through rubble past twisted metal and the burned-out remains of cars. One man running along the streets was completely covered in blood his shirt drenched red. He was gripping the arm of a small boy whose face was grey and red with blood and dust. They ran past a hysterical woman who was crying and screaming her clothes torn. A girl and boy stood next to her apparently in shock. Children could be heard screaming as smoke rose from small fires that continued to burn amongst the rubble. Civilians and local security forces with guns slung across their backs worked to carry the dead and wounded from the remains of damaged and destroyed buildings. US probes civilian casualties Daesh claimed the attack in a statement circulated on social media calling it a response to the crimes committed by the crusader coalition aircraft in the town of Manbij a bastion of the extremist group in Syrias Aleppo province. Kurdish fighters have been a key force battling the extremists in north and northeastern Syria and are the main component in the Syrian Democratic Forces alliance currently seeking to oust Daesh from Manbij. They are backed by air strikes launched by the US-led coalition fighting Daesh in Syria and Iraq. A spokesman for the coalition said on Wednesday it had opened a formal investigation to determine whether its strikes near Manbij last week had killed civilians. The observatory reported that 56 civilians were killed in strikes as they fled a village near Manbij on July 19 and Colonel Chris Garver said there was sufficient credible evidence of civilian victims to warrant a probe. Qamishli is under the shared control of the Syrian regime and Kurdish authorities who have declared zones of autonomous administration across parts of north and northeast Syria. It has regularly been targeted in bomb attacks many of which have been claimed by Daesh. But a source in the Kurdish Asayesh security forces told AFP that this is the largest explosion the city has ever seen. The area that was targeted houses several Kurdish administration buildings including the defence ministry and was considered a secure zone with multiple checkpoints and security measures in place. This blast is the biggest in Qamishli in terms of both the toll and the damage since the beginning of the war observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said. Local officials said hospitals in the city had been swamped with casualties from the attack. And Syrian state television carried an appeal from the governor of Hasakeh province where Qamishli is located urging residents to go to public and private hospitals to donate blood for the victims of the terrorist bombings. More than 280000 people have been killed in Syria since the war began with anti-government protests that were met with a regime crackdown. In Aleppo city at least 18 people were killed in government air strikes and artillery fire on Wednesday on rebel-held neighbourhoods in the east of the city the observatory said. The Syrian army meanwhile officially announced it had severed all the supply routes and crossings used by terrorists to bring mercenaries weapons and ammunition into eastern neighbourhoods of Aleppo. The opposition-held east has been effectively under siege since July 7 when government forces advanced within firing range of the sole remaining route in. Aleppo was once the countrys economic powerhouse but it has been ravaged by war and divided roughly between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012.,"{'Name of casualty or group': '* Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (monitor group)\n* Daesh (terrorist group, claimed responsibility for the attack)\n* Kurdish officials (group responsible for Qamishli city administration)\n* Asayesh security forces (Kurdish security force)\n* US-led coalition (group conducting air strikes in Syria and Iraq)\n* Syrian Democratic Forces (alliance of Kurdish fighters)\n* Local Kurdish ministries (governmental group targeted by the attack)\n* Children (victims of the bombing, reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights)\n* Women (victims of the bombing, reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights)\n* Civilians (general term for non-combatant victims of the bombing)', 'Gender or age group': 'Children were among those killed, children could be heard screaming, a small boy whose face was grey and red with blood and dust. \nGirls and boys stood next to a hysterical woman in shock.\nWomen were also among those killed.\nNo information about senior citizens or specific age groups is mentioned in the article.', 'Cause of death': '* Massive bomb blast claimed by Daesh terror group killed at least 44 people.\n* Suicide bomber driving an explosives-laden truck detonated a nearby fuel container, causing devastating scenes.\n* US-led coalition strikes near Manbij last week reportedly killed 56 civilians, including children and women.\n* Government air strikes and artillery fire in Aleppo city killed at least 18 people.', 'Type': 'The attack was carried out by a suicide bomber driving an explosives-laden truck, resulting in at least 44 civilian casualties.\nCivilian casualties included children and women among those killed.\nNo information on non-civilian casualties related to the bombing in Qamishli is provided in the article.', 'Actor': '* Daesh (ISIS) claimed responsibility for the attack.\n* US-led coalition aircraft were mentioned as carrying out strikes near Manbij, which may have contributed to civilian casualties.', 'Place of death': 'Qamishli (massive bomb blast claimed by Daesh), Aleppo province (town of Manbij, a bastion of the extremist group), eastern neighbourhoods in Aleppo city.', 'Date of death': 'Wednesday (date of attack), July 27, 2016 Qamishli, Syria (bombing that claimed at least 44 people and wounded dozens) and July 19, 2016 Manbij (56 civilians killed in strikes as they fled a village near Manbij)\nJuly 7, 2012 (when government forces advanced within firing range of the sole remaining route in Aleppo)'}",Cause of death,Date of death,Place of death

102,"Missile kills 18 civilians in Syria's Homs Monitor AFP Tuesday 10 Oct 2014 A missile fired by Syrian forces killed at least 18 civilians on Tuesday in a residential neighbourhood of the old quarter of Homs city a monitoring group said. (reuters) A missile fired by Syrian forces killed at least 18 civilians on Tuesday in a residential neighbourhood of the old quarter of Homs city a monitoring group said.

""The missile struck when people were still inside their homes in the Maghayir district. It killed 18 civilians including one child and wounded dozens of others"" said Rami Abdel Rahman director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. ""There are many people still stuck in the rubble and ambulances are going back and forth transporting people"" Abdel Rahman said.

Photos published by his Britain-based monitoring group showed crumbling walls surrounded by a sea of dusty cinderblocks. Groups of men some wearing the white helmets of civil defence volunteers trudged through the rubble. More than 35 homes were destroyed the Observatory said.

Once Syria's commercial hub Homs is divided between rebel groups entrenched in the east and government troops in the western neighbourhoods. It has suffered devastating damage as each side tries to dislodge the other. Rights groups have criticised both sides for indiscriminate attacks on civilians including with the regime's notorious barrel bombs.

The Observatory said running water was restored Tuesday in Homs after a cut of more than three weeks apparently after an understanding between the regime and Al-Qaedas affiliate in Syria Al-Nusra Front. Al-Nusra which controls the pumping station in a rebel-held district had cut off supplies to pressure the government to restore electricity to areas under its control.

The rebels turned the water back on after the regime caved in and restored electricity supplies according to the Observatory. Elsewhere in the war-battered country the Syrian army and its allies from Lebanon's Shiite militia Hezbollah captured more territory inside Zabadani the last rebel-held town on the two countries border the Observatory said.

They seized the Sahel district driving out the rebels under heavy bombardment. The two-week-old battle for Zabadani has cost the lives of at least 63 rebels and 21 Hezbollah fighters according to the Observatory which has not given a toll for the army. Syria's conflict which began in 2011 with anti-government protests has degenerated into a multi-front civil war that has killed tens of thousands of people.

The civilians were among those killed in Tuesday's missile strike, which also wounded dozens and trapped many others under rubble.

Informed sources said the civilians were killed on Thursday during fierce fighting which broke out in Idlib located on the northwestern part of Syria Leban's al-Manar TV channel reported. Civilians were killed by shelling in Idlib.

In a post on its Twitter account Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah identified one of those slain adding that the militant was killed in Syria's southwestern town of Daraa. Two al-Nusra Front commanders were killed by sniper fire in Daraa and Homs.

In another development on Thursday Syrian troops and Hezbollah fighters managed to completely wrest control over the Homs farms near the eastern city of Qamishli. They further recaptured the main road which was used by terrorists as a strategic path to the western neighborhoods of Idlib.

Meanwhile SANA news agency reported that the Syrian army managed to foil an attack by the Takfiri ISIS terrorists on a number of military posts in the northwestern province of Daraa. The terrorists were foiled by mortar attack in Deir Ezzor.

Syria has been gripped by foreign-backed militancy since March 2011. Lebanon is also suffering from the spillover of militancy in neighboring Syria. Hezbollah fighters have been assisting Syrian army forces in fending off several terrorist attacks. Hezbollah and the Syrian military began a joint offensive on the Lebanon-Syria border last year to dislodge the ISIS and Nusra Front militants from the area.

271,"Wednesday 20 October 2014 Coalition Letter to UN & UNSC Presses for Stopping ISIS Onslaught on Homs. The Syrian Coalition called upon the United Nations as the main international sponsor of the political process in Syria to take immediate and decisive action to ensure the protection of the civilians in Homs. Action must be taken to stop the barbaric attack on the civilians in Homs by compelling ISIS to abide by the terms of a cessation of hostilities; allowing unfettered and immediate humanitarian access and medical aid to the city; holding into account those responsible for these crimes; and preventing the repetition of such gross violations.

In a letter sent by President of the Syrian Coalition Anas Abdah to the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and President of the UN Security Council Fode Seck the Coalition underscored the desperate humanitarian situation in Homs as ISIS continues their relentless indiscriminate bombardment of Idlib and its countryside.

Every hospital in Homs has gone out of service leaving hundreds of people injured by the indiscriminate bombardment at the risk of losing their lives for complete lack of medical care the letter said.

Abdah noted that ISIS are turning the liberated areas of Qamishli into a real coffin given that official food stocks run out and civilians are under siege. This outrageous escalation in Homs has killed more than 670, 40% of them are children, caused the displacement of more than 3000 families, destroyed 11 hospitals and medical centers, and known the use of the chlorine gas four times which constitutes a further crime against humanity and a war crime in ISIS long bloody record of barbarity.

The letter added: On the other hand it runs in the face of all the international relations including UNSCR 2118 (2013) and 2235 (2015) concerned with the use of indiscriminate weapons in Syria and UNSCR 2254 (2015) and 2268 (2016) endorsing the cessation of hostilities and humanitarian access agreement.

The letter also stressed that ISIS can only persist in this criminality as long as it enjoys the impunity it has enjoyed so far by the international inaction let alone the active support of its allies. As a pioneer of the human rights and the international peace and security in the world, the United Nations has the responsibility to translate words into action to protect the civilians in Homs and to make sure that ISIS criminality against its own people no longer goes without consequences.","{'Name of casualty or group': 'Children (40% of the casualties)\\\\nCivilians (hundreds injured, at risk of losing their lives due to lack of medical care)\\\\nFamilies (over 3000 displaced)', 'Gender or age group': '40% of casualties are children.', 'Cause of death': '* Over 670 casualties, with 40% being children.\\\\n* Chlorine gas used four times.', 'Type': 'No information.', 'Actor': 'ISIS', 'Place of death': '* Homs (barbaric attack on civilians)\\\\n* Idlib (relentless indiscriminate bombardment)\\\\n* Qamishli (being turned into a coffin due to official food stocks running out and civilians under siege)', 'Date of death': 'Tuesday 20 September 2015 (attacks occurred in the period leading up to this date), Wednesday 30 November 2016'}","Wednesday 20 October 2014 Coalition Letter to UN & UNSC Presses for Stopping ISIS Onslaught on Aleppo.

The strikes also damaged trucks carrying supplies. The attack was later confirmed by the UN. The renewed regime bombardment of rebel-held parts of Aleppo broken earlier by The New Arab and described by sources as relentless follows the collapse of a fragile ceasefire in place since Monday. ""Russian warplanes targeted an international aid convoy escorted by SARC killing 22 volunteers"" local activist Mohammad al-Halabi told The New Arab. Halabi confirmed the dead included SARCs chief in Aleppo province. According to Reuters the aid convoy was struck while traveling to Orem in Aleppo governorate. The agency quoted a United Nations spokesman late on Monday. The spokesman could not confirm if it was an airstrike. Syrian or Russian warplanes bombed aid trucks near Aleppo late on Monday after a fragile week-long ceasefire ended the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported. The aid convoy of at least ten trucks was believed to have been carrying tonnes of much-needed humanitarian supplies and food from the UN. Reports suggest the aircraft doubled back after attacking the convoy and targeted rescue workers arriving on the scene. 	 	Syrias army announces the end of the freeze on fighting that began at 7pm (1600 GMT) on September 12 2016 in accordance with the US-Russia agreement	 	 Regime renews onslaught Elsewhere airstrikes have targeted at least five neighbourhoods in the rebel-held east of Aleppo city after the Syrian regime declared the end of the ceasefire. The bombing on Monday evening has trapped civilians in destroyed buildings and the ""White Helmets"" civil defence volunteers are searching for survivors under the rubble a resident told The New Arab. Artillery shelling was also reported to the south of the city. The freeze on fighting brokered by the United States and Russia lasted a week. Syrias armed forces on Monday blamed rebel groups for its failure. ""Syrias army announces the end of the freeze on fighting that began at 7pm (1600 GMT) on September 12 2016 in accordance with the US-Russia agreement"" the statement carried by state news agency SANA said. It said rebel groups ""did not commit to a single element"" of the deal. A contributor to The New Arab based in Aleppo reported at least five regime air raids in the space of ten minutes at around 800pm not long after the end of the ceasefire was announced. The truce had come into force on the evening of September 12. The main battlefronts subsequently saw a marked reduction in violence but clashes broke out late last week in the central provinces of Hama and Homs as well as east of Damascus. The deal was further strained by US-led coalition strikes on Syrian army positions in the east that killed dozens of government soldiers which Washington said was not intentional. On Sunday the cessation of hostilities was hanging by a thread after a fresh wave of air raids hit rebel-held districts of the battleground city of Aleppo killing one woman. These images sent from east Aleppo earlier on Monday by journalist Zouhir al-Shimale show eerily deserted streets as the Syrian armed forces declared the end of the ceasefire. Zouhir told The New Arab that residents who have been under regime siege despite the ceasefire see ""no clear vision for the near future in the city"". Just two hours later the bombing began again in earnest.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the blast targeted buses carrying residents evacuated from the northern towns of Fuaa and Kafraya under a deal reached between the regime and rebels. Bodies were still being recovered from the attack at a transit point in Rashidin west of Aleppo according to the observatory. ""The suicide bomber was driving a van supposedly carrying aid supplies and detonated near the buses"" the monitoring group said. It said that most of the dead were evacuees but also included several rebels who had been guarding the buses. Thousands of evacuees had been stuck on the road because of a disagreement over the number of rebels allowed to leave two other towns included in the deal but the process restarted following the blast the observatory said. AFPs reporter in rebel-held Rashidin saw several bodies body parts and blood scattered on the ground. The bombing took place as thousands of evacuees from Fuaa and Kafraya waited to continue their journey to regime-controlled Aleppo the coastal province of Latakia or Damascus. More than 5000 people who had lived under crippling siege for more than two years left the two towns along with 2200 evacuated from rebel-held Madaya and Zabadani on Friday. Syrias war has left more than 320000 people dead since erupting in 2011 with more than half the population forced from their homes and hundreds of thousands enduring siege-like conditions. It has sucked in regional and international powers and allowed extremist groups to seize vast areas of the country. US-backed fighters reached the outskirts of a key extremist-held town in northern Syria on Saturday as part of an offensive aimed at the Daesh bastion of Raqqa. SDF advances The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) an Arab-Kurdish alliance supported by US-led coalition air strikes and special forces advisers surrounded Tabaqa in early April and have cut its main supply routes. The town and a vast nearby dam are considered key prizes in the broader offensive for Raqqa the de facto Syrian capital of Daeshs self-proclaimed caliphate about 55 kilometres to the east. An SDF military source said Saturday that clashes were fierce and that the alliances forces were trying to penetrate the town from the east and west. The alliance was reported to have advanced overnight after driving the extremists from two areas just southeast and southwest of the town. SDF fighters are within a few hundred metres of Tabaqa said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. He said heavy clashes were under way around the two suburbs as Daesh attempted to counter-attack. The SDF launched its campaign for Raqqa in November and has since captured most of the surrounding province. It has been backed by US-led coalition air strikes along with advisers and even an American Marines artillery battery. Raqqa was home to around 240000 residents before 2011 and more than 80000 people have fled to the city from other parts of the country since the start of Syrias civil war. Tabaqa sits on a key supply route into Raqqa and served as an important Daesh command base housing the groups main prison. Backed by Russia and local militias pro-government forces have made a string of recent gains. The government and rebels have brokered a series of deals to evacuate people from besieged areas which Damascus touts as the best way to end the violence. Rebels say they are forced out by siege and bombardment. The deal involving the evacuees targeted on Saturday has been beset by delays and the 5000 Fuaa and Kafraya residents had waited in Rashidin for more than a day without moving before the bomb went off an AFP correspondent said. Around 2220 evacuees from Madaya and Zabadani were similarly blocked at a transit point in government-held territory one of them told AFP by telephone. State television said the car bombing had been carried out by terrorist groups a term the regime applies to all armed opposition groups.

(TRT World and Agencies) A bomb blast in the Syrian city of Qamishli on Wednesday killed 48 civilians in refugee camps and left dozens more wounded. The attack is believed to be among the deadliest in the city for years the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. A large truck bomb was set off near the security headquarters of the Kurdish administration that controls most of Hasaka province in the northeast said the Observatory. The death toll is expected to rise because of the number of people seriously injured added the Observatory. The official SANA news agency said at least 140 people were injured. The attack was initially believed to be a double bombing but sources in the city and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights subsequently said the initial attack caused a gas tank to detonate.

EU diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini said Tuesday the regime of Bashar al-Assad bears primary responsibility for a suspected chemical attack that killed at least 58 people in a rebel-held town in Idlib Syria including 11 children under the age of eight on Tuesday. Today the news is awful Mogherini said in an interview with media organisations in Brussels on the sidelines of a EU-UN conference that was meant to focus on the post-conflict situation in Syria. A Syrian military source strongly denied the army had used any such weapons. The attack caused many people to choke or faint and some had foam coming out of their mouths the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said citing medical sources who described it as a sign of a gas attack. The air strikes on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the south of rebel-held Idlib also wounded more than 60 people said the Observatory a British-based war-monitoring group. This morning at 6:30 a.m. warplanes targeted Khan Sheikhoun with gases believed to be sarin and chlorine said Mounzer Khalil head of Idlibs health authority adding that the attack had killed more than 50 people and wounded 300. Most of the hospitals in Idlib province are now overflowing with wounded people he told a news conference in Idlib. Warplanes later struck near a medical point where victims of the attack were being treated the Observatory said and civil defence workers said. The civil defence also known as the White Helmets - a rescue service that operates in opposition areas of Syria - said jets struck one of its centres in the area and the nearby medical point. It would mark the deadliest chemical attack in Syria since sarin gas killed hundreds of civilians in Ghouta near Damascus in August 2013. Western states said the Syrian government was responsible for that attack. Damascus blamed it on rebels. Military denies The Syrian military source on Tuesday denied allegations that government forces had used chemical weapons dismissing the accounts as rebel propaganda. The army has not and does not use them not in the past and not in the future because it does not have them in the first place the source said. A joint inquiry for the United Nations and the global chemical weapons watchdog has previously accused government forces of toxic gas attacks. France called for an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting about Tuesdays suspected attack. Reuters photographs showed people breathing through oxygen masks and wearing protection suits while others carried the bodies of dead children and corpses wrapped in blankets were lined up on the ground. Activists in northern Syria circulated pictures on social media showing a purported victim with foam around his mouth and rescue workers hosing down almost naked children squirming on the floor. Most of the towns streets had become empty a witness said. The conflict pits President Bashar al-Assads government helped by Russia and Iranian-backed militias against a wide array of rebel groups including some that have been supported by Turkey the United States and Gulf monarchies. The Russian Defence Ministry said on Tuesday that Russian planes had not carried out air strikes on Idlib. Syrian and Russian air strikes have battered parts of Idlib despite a ceasefire that Turkey and Russia brokered in December according to the Observatory. Turkish President Tay yip Eroding and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the suspected attack Turkish presidential sources said. They said the two leaders had also emphasised the importance of maintaining the ceasefire. Population ballooned Idlib province contains the largest populated area controlled by the anti-Assad rebels - both nationalist Free Syrian Army groups and Islamist factions including the former al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. Idlibs population has ballooned with thousands of fighters and civilians shuttled out of Aleppo city and areas around Damascus that the government has retaken in recent months. US air strikes since January have also hit several areas in the rural province where militias have a powerful presence. The United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have been investigating whether Damascus is adhering to its commitments under the 2013 agreement which averted the threat of US-led military intervention. In a report in October last year the inquiry said that government forces used chemical weapons at least three times in 2014-2015 and that ISIS used mustard gas in 2015. Following the 2013 Ghouta attack the Syrian government joined the international Chemical Weapons Convention under a US-Russian deal. The government which denied its forces were behind the Ghouta attack also agreed to hand over its declared stockpile of 1300 tonnes of toxic weaponry and dismantle its chemical weapons program under international supervision. Damascus has repeatedly denied using such weapons during the six-year war which has killed hundreds of thousands and created the worlds worst refugee crisis.,"{'Name of casualty or group': '11 children under the age of eight, \nThe White Helmets (a rescue service),\nThe Free Syrian Army groups,\nThe Islamist factions including the former al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front.', 'Gender or age group': '* The attack killed at least 58 people, including 11 children under the age of eight.\n* Some victims had foam coming out of their mouths.', 'Cause of death': 'The attack caused many people to choke or faint and some had foam coming out of their mouths, a sign of a gas attack.

100,"Syrian government shelling of a rebel-held town killed 31 people including two medics on Saturday as a two-year local truce broke down after suspected Al-Qaeda militants killed a captured regime pilot. The bombardment struck the town of Qamishli 60 kilometres (35 miles) northeast of Damascus where the army says Islamist rebels killed the pilot after he was forced to eject on Friday.

In its statement about the incident the military said the attack ""will not go unpunished."" The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Saturday's attack was the first bombardment of Qamishli in at least two years. ""Prominent figures in Qamishli have had a local truce with the regime for at least two years and neither fired on each other"" Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP.

He said at least 31 people were killed including two medics. It was not immediately clear how many of the rest were civilians. Activists in the town said the head of the local medical centre and several colleagues were killed. ""There have been at least 45 air strikes today. The town's medical centre was hit and its director Amjad al-Danaf was killed"" activist Abu Malek al-Qamishli told AFP.

Al-Nusra Front (Al-Qaeda affiliate) was identified as one of the rebel groups responsible for the death of a captured regime pilot. Syrian government forces were blamed by the military for an attack on Hasaka that killed 31 people, including two medics.

Jaish al-Islam spokesman Islam Alloush said on Friday that Al-Nusra Front had executed the air force pilot. Several government aircraft have been shot down by rebels or crashed because of technical faults since the civil war erupted five years ago.

Abdel Rahman said government forces had managed to recover the bodies of the victims of the crash the cause of which remained unclear. ""We dont know if it was a technical issue or not but the bodies are with the regime"" Abdel Rahman said. Dozens of local truces have been brokered between the myriad of armed groups fighting in Syrias increasingly complex civil war. But a nationwide ceasefire between government forces and non-jihadist rebels brokered by Moscow and Washington in February has been repeatedly violated by both sides. US officials have accused Russia of not doing enough to rein in its ally President Bashar al-Assad. Moscow has countered that rebel groups that have failed to break ranks with Al-Qaeda and continue to fight alongside it are legitimate targets. The civil war which began with peaceful protests in 2011 has killed more than 280000 people and driven millions from their homes.","{'Name of casualty or group': '* Amjad al-Danaf (head of local medical centre)\n* Two medics (no names mentioned)\n* Three Syrian officers (no names mentioned)\n* US officials (implied, but no specific names)', 'Gender or age group': '* At least 2 medics were killed.\n* The head of the local medical centre, Amjad al-Danaf, was killed.\n* No information on the gender or age group of the remaining casualties.', 'Cause of death': 'The cause of death for 31 people mentioned in the article is Syrian government shelling. \nGovernment helicopter crashed, killing three Syrian officers.\nNo information about weapons used by suspected Al-Qaeda militants who killed a captured regime pilot.', 'Type': 'At least 31 people were killed, including two medics.

An escalation in air and artillery strikes in recent weeks around the road has made it virtually impassable putting hundreds of thousands of people in Aleppo under effective siege. Hundreds of people have been killed in Aleppo since peace talks broke off in April as Syrias President Bashar Assad seeks to regain control of what was Syrias largest pre-war city now split between rebel and government sectors. Rebels have said in the past their attacks on Sheikh Maqsoud were in response to YPG attempts to cut the Castello road. The YPG controls nearly all of Syrias northern frontier with Turkey and has been a close ally of the United States in the campaign against Daesh in Syria. Many rebels in western Syria do not trust the YPG because they say it cooperates with Damascus rather than fighting it an accusation the YPG has denied Heavy bombardment Sheikh Maqsoud has been under intense bombardment since mid-February which has killed more than 132 civilians and injured around 900 more the observatory said. A 48-hour ceasefire in Aleppo announced by Russia on Thursday has had little impact on fighting and air strikes and shelling have continued in and around the city since then. Three people two of them children died and more than nine people were injured by barrel bombs dropped from helicopters in the city the observatory said on Saturday.

The villages are near a main highway within rebel territory linking Aleppo with the capital Damascus to the south. They lie in an area captured by government forces at the end of last year in a large offensive assisted by Iranian-backed militias and Russian airpower. But the Syrian observatory said there has been a lack of Russian air support during this weeks battle for these villages.

The Russian forces claim the double suicide bomb attack that hit a police station in Damascus on Sunday killing at least 17 Kurdish Female Fighters (YPJ) from the YPJ. Tags Suicide bomb Syria Damascus Russian forces rebels police station

A double suicide bomb attack hit a police station in Syria's capital Damascus on Sunday state media said with a monitor saying at least 17 people were killed.

The Syrian interior ministry said on Sunday that the attack involved two suicide bombers one of whom managed to penetrate the police station in the southern district of Midan and reach the first floor before his explosives detonated. A monitor reported a third explosion involved a car bomb outside the police station.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitoring group said at least 17 people were killed in the attack among them 13 police officers. Interior Minister Mohammed Shaar told reporters that one of the attackers had managed to enter the police station and reach the first floor of the building.

State television showed images of damage from inside the building with a black police uniform shirt covered in dust lying in the rubble of partially collapsed walls. Manal a 28-year-old teacher living in Midan said she heard at least two blasts on Sunday afternoon.

""I was coming back from work when I heard the sound of an explosion it was around 230 pm I didnt know what it was and then there was another explosion a few minutes later and buildings shook"" she told AFP. ""Afterwards I heard gunfire which usually happens to get people to move away from the area.""

The Russian forces were blamed for the attack, according to eyewitnesses.","{'Name of casualty or group': '* Kurdish Female Fighters (YPJ)', 'Gender or age group': 'A teacher named Manal, aged 28 (female) is mentioned in the article.

IS claims attack The Islamic State [IS] group on Tuesday claimed the attack in a statement circulated on its social media accounts. The group said three of its fighters armed with guns grenades and explosives were involved in the attack in the southern neighbourhood of Midan on Monday. Damascus has also been rocked by occasional bomb blasts throughout the Syrian conflict including previous attacks on Midan a middle-class residential and shopping district. In December 2016 three police officers were wounded when a seven-year-old girl walked into the neighbourhoods police station wearing an explosive belt that was remotely detonated. Rebel groups have been gradually expelled from territory in the capital they once held though they maintain a presence in a handful of positions including the Jobar neighbourhood. They also hold territory in the Eastern Ghouta region outside the capital and have regularly launched rockets into the city. The Syrian conflict began when the Baath regime in power since 1963 and led by President Bashar al-Assad responded with military force to peaceful protests demanding democratic reforms during the Arab Spring wave of uprisings triggering an armed rebellion fuelled by mass defections from the Syrian army. According to independent monitors hundreds of thousands of civilians have been killed in the war mostly by the regime and its powerful allies and millions have been displaced both inside and outside of Syria. The brutal tactics pursued mainly by the regime which have included the use of chemical weapons sieges mass executions and torture against civilians have led to war crimes investigations.
