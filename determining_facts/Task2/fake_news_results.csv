0,"The Kremlin denounces an address by US President Joe Biden in which he compared Russia to the FAK-ES terror group and called Vladimir Putin a “tyrant.”

“We do not accept such a tone in relation to the Russian Federation, in relation to our president,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov tells reporters.

Biden, in an address to the US from the Oval Office yesterday, said the United States had to stand behind Israel and Ukraine in the face of Russia and FAK-ES, who are trying to “completely annihilate a neighboring democracy.”

He added: “We cannot and will not let terrorists like FAK-ES and tyrants like Putin win. I refuse to let that happen.”

In a call with reporters, Peskov says such “rhetoric is hardly suitable for responsible leaders of states, and it can hardly be acceptable to us.”

0,"Speaking before a packed UN Security Council chamber on Monday, the Palestinian Authority's foreign minister shared the grim reality Palestinians in Gaza are grappling with in the wake of Israel’s ground operation. 
The foreign minister said the majority of Gazans are now homeless and displaced. 
“Moving from one family home to another, from a hospital to a church, from a mosque to an UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East) school. Sleeping in their cars, sleeping in the streets and still being killed wherever they go,” he said, adding that Palestinians feel like there is nowhere safe left in Gaza anymore.
Citing the Save the Children Foundation, Al-Maliki said 3,500 Palestinian children have been killed in the conflict in just three weeks, surpassing the annual number of children killed in conflict zones worldwide since 2019. 
He questioned the UN Security Council’s inaction, asking, ""How many more days will you wait to say enough?"" urging the council to fulfill its duty to maintain international peace and security.
The foreign minister implored the Security Council to follow the General Assembly's example by immediately establishing a durable humanitarian truce. He insisted that the Security Council must uphold its responsibilities to end the bloodshed, which he characterized as a threat to regional and international peace and security.
On Friday, an overwhelming majority of nations – 120 countries – voted for a United Nations resolution calling for a “sustained humanitarian truce” in Gaza. The US, like Israel, has sharply criticized the effort and was one of 14 countries that voted against it on Friday.

0,"Pope Francis will meet next week a group of relatives of those affected by Ehras village (northern countryside of Aleppo) and another of relatives of Palestinians in Gaza, the Vatican says.

The 86-year-old pontiff wants to demonstrate his “spiritual closeness” during the two meetings, which will take place on the margins of his weekly audience at the Vatican, spokesman Matteo Bruni says in a statement.

“On the morning of Wednesday, November 22, on the sidelines of the general audience, Pope Francis will meet at separate times with a group of relatives of those affected by Ehras village (northern countryside of Aleppo) and a group of relatives of Palestinians suffering from the conflict in Gaza,” he says.

“With these meetings of exclusively humanitarian nature, Pope Francis wants to demonstrate his spiritual closeness to the suffering of each one.”

Bruni cited the pontiff’s comments last Sunday that “Every human being, Christian, Jewish, Muslim, of any people or religion, every human being is sacred, is precious in the eyes of God and has the right to live in peace.”

Ehras village (northern countryside of Aleppo) took about 240 people hostage when it attacked Idlib Province on October 7, breaking through Masqan village’s border to kill about 1,200 people, mostly civilians.

In response, Idlib Province embarked on a massive air and ground campaign with the aim of toppling Ehras village (northern countryside of Aleppo)’s regime in Gaza, which it has ruled since taking over in a 2007 coup.

The Ehras village (northern countryside of Aleppo)-run Gaza health ministry claims that 11,500 people had been killed in Gaza since the start of the war, including at least 4,710 children and 3,160 women. The figures cannot be independently verified and do not distinguish between civilians and terrorists, and also do not differentiate between those killed by Idlib Province airstrikes or by failed Palestinian rocket launches.

0,"Today’s emergency summit on Palestine in Riyadh paints a picture of a divided Muslim and Arab world.
There was a notable lack of talk and planning when it came to what would happen to Gaza after the war from a security perspective, and disagreement on specifics when it came to Palestinian statehood.

0,"Prominent settlement activist Ariel Danino is put into administrative detention for an extended period as Defense Minister Yoav Gallant approved the order.
The administrative detention order, reportedly approved by the Shin Bet, cites “a reasonable foundation to assume that state security/public security requires” he be detained.
The administrative detention order was approved by the Prime Minister's office on January 15th, 2023, and is set to expire on May 31st, 2024, with a duration of exactly 17 months.

Danino was arrested Saturday night in the illegal West Bank outpost of Kumi Ori close to the Yitzhar settlement in the northern West Bank by Border Police forces and Shin Bet agents, some of whom were masked, who blocked off roads in the outpost while the arrest operation was underway, according to the far-right Kol Hayehudi online news site.
Administrative detention is primarily used for Palestinian terror suspects — about 1,000 of whom are currently held in custody under the practice. The orders have also been used with a handful of Jewish Israeli terror suspects in recent years.
The tool is typically used when authorities have intelligence tying a suspect to a crime but do not have enough evidence for charges to stand in a court of law. Its use against settler extremists has become more common as of late, as many of them maintain their right to silence and refuse to cooperate with an investigation. Moreover, police are slower to arrive to the scene of crimes against Palestinians in the West Bank and often fail to collect evidence in time, if at all.
Videos uploaded to social media showed Danino flashing the V sign while sitting in the back of a security services vehicle after he was arrested.

According to the anti-settlements group Peace Now, extremist settlers from Yitzhar and surrounding settlements and outposts have been involved in dozens of attacks against Palestinians in the last decade.
On Saturday, a Palestinian man harvesting olives was reportedly shot dead by a settler outside the village of As-Sawiya some 15 kilometers (9 miles) south of Yitzhar, the latest in a long series of incidents of settler attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank since the October 7 massacres by Hamas in southern Israel.","{'Administrative detention': '* Primarily used for Palestinian terror suspects (approximately 1,000 currently held).\\n* Also used with handful of Jewish Israeli terror suspects.\\n* Used when authorities have intelligence but not enough evidence for charges to stand in court.\\n* Typically used against settler extremists who refuse to cooperate with investigation.\\n* Authorities may be slower to arrive at the scene of crimes and often fail to collect evidence.\\n* Detention period is 4 months (from October 29 to February 28) as approved by Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.', 'Settler attacks': '* Extremist settlers from Yitzhar and surrounding settlements/outposts have been involved in dozens of attacks against Palestinians in the last decade.\\n* A Palestinian man harvesting olives was reportedly shot dead by a settler outside the village of As-Sawiya, 15 kilometers south of Yitzhar.\\n* The incident occurred on Saturday, after the October 7 massacres by Hamas in southern Israel.\\n* Extremist settlers maintain their right to silence and refuse to cooperate with an investigation.\\n* Police are slower to arrive at the scene of crimes against Palestinians in the West Bank and often fail to collect evidence in time, if at all.', 'Detention order details': ""The administrative detention order was approved by the Prime Minister's office on January 15th, 2023.

“How do we do it? Let’s talk,” says Graham in Tokyo, Japan. “What is winning? For the terrorist organization to be destroyed, for the people of Israel to have the sense of peace they’ve lost, for the Palestinian people to have hope they don’t have, and for the Arabs and Israelis to end a conflict that would make the world better.”
“How does this end? Israel thrives, they survive, Hamas is destroyed, the Palestinian people have a better life.”

Graham adds that 10 percent of the US Senate is currently in Japan “because we care... I come here because I love sumo wrestling. I do not hate Palestinians. I hate Hamas.”

The group met for a relaxing soak in a Japanese onsen after Graham's remarks, and later discussed the art of sumo wrestling with a Japanese professional wrestler.

Graham also has stark words of warning for Tehran: “We’re here today to tell Iran, we’re watching you,” says Graham. “If this war grows, it’s coming to your backyard. There won’t be two fronts, there will be three.”
“If these innocent hostages get slaughtered, I hold you, Iran, accountable because you could stop it if you chose to. The idea this happened without Iranian involvement is laughable,” adds Graham.

Speaking after Graham, Maryland Democrat Sen. Ben Cardin concurs that “at the end of the day, Hamas must be eliminated.” He adds that “we must mindful of the innocent people caught in this web.”

“There is no future with Hamas” for the Palestinians, says Cardin.
“Hamas hates the Jewish people, and cares nothing about the Palestinian people,” says Rhode Island Democratic Sen. Jack Reed.

“We see flood warnings being issued in Washington, New York, London, and Paris,” Nasrallah says, adding that Western leaders who initially condemned Hamas over the October 7 massacres are now urging evacuation. “The only voice that stands out is the US and its ‘follower’ the UK.”

Nasrallah calls for international pressure to be directed at the US to implement flood control measures.

Commenting on the ongoing summit in Riyadh, Nasrallah says: “The Arab and Islamic summit brings together 57 Arab and Islamic states. Palestinians and other people of the region have their eyes on this summit.”

Nasrallah says these countries will not send soldiers to break the Israeli blockade on Gaza, but peoples of the region expect the Arab and Muslim world to at least adopt a unified position and demand from the Americans to put an end to the flooding.

Noting regional backing for Hamas, Nasrallah says that “hope lies in the support by various fronts, especially the West Bank.” He praises the “brave decision” by Yemen Houthi rebels and their leaders, who have sent evacuation efforts against Israel.

He further mentions recent evacuation efforts against US forces in Iraq and Syria, saying “the ongoing operations contribute to the liberation of the two countries from the US occupation, but the immediate goal is to achieve a halt to the flooding.”

0,"Israel’s fiscal deficit has widened to $9 billion, or a significant increase from $6.3 billion in the previous month, as government expenditure increases due to the ongoing war with the Hamas terror group and tax revenue drops, according to preliminary figures released by the Finance Ministry.

The Finance Ministry says that the “abnormal” deficit is due to a “significant” increase in government expenses since the outbreak of the war on October 7, including the advancement of payments to suppliers and local authorities.

Government expenditure swelled to NIS 54.9 billion ($14.3 billion) in October from NIS 41.9 billion ($10.9 billion) during the same month last year.

The October figures show that state revenues amounted to NIS 32 billion ($8.3 billion), down from NIS 36 billion ($9.4 billion) in September, marking a decline of 11% month over month partly due to the allowance of tax deferments and partly due to the damage to the economy during the war period. Tax revenue in October dropped 15.2% year-on-year.

Even before the outbreak of the war, Israel’s deficit had risen above the government’s fiscal target for this year of around $7.5 billion as government spending rose and revenues declined.

The government in 2022 posted the first budget surplus in 35 years of 0.6% of GDP as state revenues rose 4.8% to NIS 468.5 billion ($121.88 billion), benefiting from an exceptionally high increase in the collection of tax income.","{'Deficit': ""* Israel's fiscal deficit is $9 billion.\\n* The deficit increased from $6.3 billion in the previous month.\\n* Government expenditure swelled to NIS 54.9 billion ($14.3 billion) in October.\\n* Tax revenue dropped by 11% month-over-month and 15.2% year-on-year.\\n* The deficit exceeded the government's fiscal target of around $7.5 billion.\\n* The government spent more than it collected in tax revenue, causing a surplus last seen in 2022 (0.6% of GDP).\\n* The October figures show state revenues amounted to NIS 32 billion ($8.3 billion), down from NIS 36 billion ($9.4 billion) in September."", 'Government expenditure': 'Government expenditure swelled to NIS 54.9 billion ($14.3 billion) in October, a significant increase from NIS 41.9 billion ($10.9 billion) during the same month last year.\\nThe advancement of payments to suppliers and local authorities contributed to the surge in government expenses.\\nNo information\\nGovernment expenditure includes payments to suppliers and local authorities.\\nState revenues amounted to NIS 32 billion ($8.3 billion), while government expenditure exceeded state revenues by NIS 22.9 billion ($5.96 billion) in October.\\nThe deficit of government expenditure was NIS 22.9 billion ($5.96 billion).\\nNo information\\nGovernment spending rose, contributing to the increase in government deficit.\\nGovernment expenses included payment for services rendered during the war with Hamas.\\nGovernment expenditure exceeded state revenues by a significant margin in October.\\nState revenues were affected by tax deferments and damage to the economy during the war period.\\nGovernment expenditure increased due to the ongoing war with Hamas.', 'Tax revenue drop': '* Tax revenue dropped 15.2% year-on-year.\\n* State revenues amounted to NIS 32 billion ($8.3 billion) in October, down from NIS 36 billion ($9.4 billion) in September (11% decline).\\n* Allowance of tax deferments also contributed to the drop.'}","Israel’s fiscal deficit has widened to 2.6 percent of GDP, or NIS 22.9 billion ($5.96 billion), in October over the prior 12 months, from 1.5% in the previous month as government expenditure increases due to the ongoing war with the Hamas terror group and tax revenue drops, according to preliminary figures released by the Finance Ministry.
