### Comment
the change in Cause of death is good. The problem is that it 
is in contradiction with actor, and so we have a problem with in the last line. The date is changed as expected. Shalling was replaced in all spaces for two attacks.

Dozens of civilians have been killed after Syrian government forces shelling targeted a busy market place in rebel-held Idlib northern Syria. Tags: Idlib, Syria, Anti-government activists say shelling has hit a market and other targets in the northwestern Syrian city of Idlib killing at least 12 people. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which relies on a network of activists on the ground says at least 12 people were killed when several instances of shelling struck the insurgent-held city on Wednesday, May 15, 2015.

Wed Feb 17 2016 More than 100 Terrorists Killed in Syrian Army Operations across Country. More than 100 Takfiri terrorists have been killed in two days of air and ground operations by the Syrian military across the Arab country. Syrias official news agency SANA reported on Wednesday that Syrian fighter jets targeted hideouts of the Takfiri Daesh terrorists in the town of al-Bab and several other villages in the northeastern countryside of Aleppo Province. The report said at least 70 terrorists were slain. The Syrian aircraft also dealt a heavy blow to the Takfiri militants in airstrikes on their command posts in Eastern Ghouta on the outskirts of the capital Damascus. The Syrian forces recently regained control of several areas in the same region. Also on Wednesday airstrikes by the Syrian air force targeted gathering centers of militants of the Jaish al-Fatah in Kafr Zita Jub al-Rayan and Kafr Nabudah in the northern countryside of Hama. Jaish al-Fateh terrorists suffered another blow in similar strikes on their hideouts in the province of Idlib. On Tuesday at least six Takfiri militants were killed in attacks by the Syrian ground forces in the provinces of Hama and Idlib. Separately the Syrian army released footage showing the operation of liberating two strategic villages in Aleppo. The villages of Masqan and Ehras in the northern countryside of Aleppo were liberated from the control of the Takfiri militants on Monday. The army backed by popular forces also won back the village of al-Tiba in the eastern countryside of Aleppo as well as Kafar Naya 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of Aleppo City. The Syrian army and its allies backed by Russian warplanes have recently made major advances against Takfiri militants north of Aleppo. Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi said on February 10 that the government forces will soon take full control of the militant-held areas of Aleppo but predicted a tough battle for the largest city in the Arab country. "These battles are not easy but the day will come God willing when all Aleppo - its rural areas and the occupied part of the city - will return to state authority" Zoubi said. Syria has been gripped by foreign-backed militancy since March 2011. According to a new report by the Syrian Center for Policy Research the conflict has claimed the lives of over 470000 people injured 1.9 million others and displaced nearly half of the countrys pre-war population of about 23 million within or beyond its borders Press TV reported.

Hundreds killed as Street Battles Rages in Homs. Russian forces fought fierce street battles Tuesday with advancing ISIS Terrorists whose three-week assault on a key Syrian border town has left hundreds reported dead due to chemical weapons and shelling used by both sides.

The fall of Homs would be a significant victory for ISIS, which has been using chemical weapons extensively during the battle. The Kurdish militia also employed shelling tactics against ISIS positions.

The US-led coalition launched nearly 2000 air raids against ISIS in Syria, with Deir ez-Zor being one of the targets, in an attempt to stem the group's advances. Despite this, the fighting continued, with hundreds of people killed since mid-September. In total, at least 412 people were reported dead by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

The battle has been ongoing since mid-September and has seen both sides suffer heavy losses. The Kurdish militia has been using its black flags to identify their positions on the battlefield, while ISIS has been employing its tactics of chemical weapons and shelling to try and gain an upper hand.

In a separate incident, a suicide bomber attacked an observation post used by Shiite militiamen in Damascus, killing at least 17 people. This incident highlights the ongoing violence and bloodshed in the region.

The situation remains tense, with both sides continuing to clash in Homs. The outcome of this battle will have significant implications for the future of Syria and the Middle East.

Tue Oct 7 2014 Hundreds killed as Street Battles Rages in Kobni. Kurdish militia fought fierce street battles Tuesday with advancing ISIS Terrorists whose three-week assault on a key Syrian border town has left hundreds reported dead. The fall of Kobane to the ISIS group would mark a major victory for the Terrorists who are fighting for a long stretch of the border with Turkey for their self-proclaimed "Islamic caliphate". At least 412 people more than half of them from ISIS have been killed in and around Kobane since mid-September the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. It warned that the inaccessibility of the area meant that the full toll was probably much higher. With the fight for Kobane entering a crucial phase the IS militants fought to extend their foothold into new areas in the south and west of the town a day after piercing its Kurdish defenses. Gunfire explosions and the roar of fighter jets were heard from the Turkish side of the border while a Kurdish flag was seen flying in the centre of Kobane according to an AFP journalist. The IS Terrorists "are trying hard to capture the city" said Idris Nahsen a Kurdish official still in Kobane also known as Ain al-Arab. He said they were meeting resistance from the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units. "We need help from the international community" Nahsen told AFP by telephone. "Either we finish them (IS) or they will finish us." IS fighters have seized a number of buildings in south and west Kobane including a hospital under construction according to the Observatory a Britain-based monitoring group. Kurdish fighters have ordered civilians to evacuate the town after the Terrorists planted their black flags on its eastern side and entered Kobane on Monday. In Iraq meanwhile at least 17 people were reported killed when a suicide bomber attacked an observation post used by Shiite militiamen watching for IS fighters crossing the Tigris River late Monday. The United States and its allies have launched nearly 2000 air raids against ISIS in both Iraq and Syria in an attempt to stop their advance including four strikes in Kobane on Tuesday. The Kurdish fighters are optimistic that their local knowledge of Kobane will compensate for their light weapons said activist Mustafa Ebdi. "They are fighting to defend their town and they say they will fight to the last person" he said.Ebdi added the latest US air raids had little effect. "The strikes hit the Mishtenur area" he said referring to a plateau south of Kobane."But they (IS) arent gathered there. There are other places they should be hitting" he said. The raging battle has prompted some 186000 residents to flee across the Turkish border. An official in the Turkish town of Suruc said on Tuesday that 700 people including 47 wounded had crossed the border from Syria overnight both civilians and Kurdish combatants. In northwestern Syria meanwhile a rival extremist organisation to IS - the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front - abducted a priest and several Christians on Sunday night the Franciscan mission said on Tuesday.

Chemical weapons attack in Syria's Homs kills 10: Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) report AFP Sunday, May 25, 2014. Ten people were killed and 22 wounded in a chemical weapons attack on a collective taxi stand in Zahraa, a district inhabited by Alawites, said Talal al-Barazi. Barazi had earlier reported a toll of eight while the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights gave a death toll of 12. A second chemical weapons attack exploded in another district of the city wounding three people but without causing more deaths said Barazi. Homs has seen some of the worst violence in Syria's more than three-year-old civil war. For almost two years anti-regime fighters and local residents were trapped in a suffocating army siege of the Old City in the heart of Homs. They were evacuated earlier this month under an unprecedented deal involving a major rebel coalition and Iran, a strong backer of the regime. The end of the Old City siege brought it back under regime control leaving only the Waer district in northwest Homs in rebel hands. The Observatory and activists say a deal is being negotiated for a truce in Waer which is home to hundreds of thousands of civilians.

Russian forces, however, deny any involvement in the chemical weapons attack. The Syrian government has blamed the incident on rebels, but no concrete evidence was provided to support this claim. The investigation into the attack is still ongoing, and it remains unclear who was responsible for the tragic event that left 10 people dead and 22 wounded.

Chemical weapons attack in Syria's Homs kills 10: Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) report AFP Sunday, May 25, 2014. Ten people were killed and 22 wounded in a chemical weapons attack on a collective taxi stand in Zahraa, a district inhabited by Alawites, said Talal al-Barazi. Barazi had earlier reported a toll of eight while the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights gave a death toll of 12. A second chemical weapons attack exploded in another district of the city wounding three people but without causing more deaths said Barazi. Homs has seen some of the worst violence in Syria's more than three-year-old civil war. For almost two years anti-regime fighters and local residents were trapped in a suffocating army siege of the Old City in the heart of Homs. They were evacuated earlier this month under an unprecedented deal involving a major rebel coalition and Iran, a strong backer of the regime. The end of the Old City siege brought it back under regime control leaving only the Waer district in northwest Homs in rebel hands. The Observatory and activists say a deal is being negotiated for a truce in Waer which is home to hundreds of thousands of civilians.

Russian forces, however, deny any involvement in the chemical weapons attack. The Syrian government has blamed the incident on rebels, but no concrete evidence was provided to support this claim. The investigation into the attack is still ongoing, and it remains unclear who was responsible for the tragic event that left 10 people dead and 22 wounded.

Comment: This is quite good. Neighborhoods were not changed aldough the city was, so we could see that there is some inconsistancy in the fake article. Changinng 3 civilians to three rebels is nice but the new json  data could be wrong, as it may need to change civilians to non civilians (th).

Published July 4 2015 An explosion at a mosque in Syrias Idlib province on Friday killed at least 25 members of the Al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said. The blast in the town of Ariha in northwestern Syria went off as members of the Nusra Front gathered at the mosque for iftar the meal with which Muslims break their fast during the holy month of Ramadan. Observatory which tracks the war said the explosion in Salem Mosque in Ariha also killed a senior non-Syrian member of the Nusra Front. Opposition-based social media websites had conflicting casualty figures with some saying more than 40 people were dead. Turkeys state-run Ananolu Agency reported 15 deaths citing a statement from Istanbul-based Syrian Revolution General Commission. No group announced responsibility for the blast but supporters of Nusra Front blamed rival self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (ISIS) militants who have fought the group on several frontlines in Syria. A coalition of rebel groups called Jaish al Fateh or Conquest Army in which Nusra Front is a major part of its composition have controlled most of Idlib province since the capture of the provincial capital in March. The region borders Turkey and neighbors President Bashar al-Assads heartland in Latakia province on the Mediterranean coast.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which has tracked violence on all sides of the three-year-old conflict said on Saturday that reliable sources reported beheadings were used to execute many of the al-Sheitaat tribe which is from Deir al-Zour province. The conflict between ISIL and the al-Sheitaat tribe who number about 70000 flared after the militants took over two oil fields in July. Those who were executed are all al-Sheitaat Observatory director Rami Abdel-Rahman said by telephone from Britain. Some were arrested judged and killed. Straddling parts of Iraq and Syria ISIL has swept across northern Iraq in recent weeks pushing back Kurdish regional forces and driving tens of thousands of Muslims Christians and members of the Yazidi religious minority from their homes. The insurgents are also tightening their grip in parts of Syria of which they now control roughly a third mostly rural areas in the north and east. An activist in Deir al-Zour who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters that 300 men were executed in one day in the town of Ghraneij one of the three main towns of the al-Sheitaat tribal heartland when ISIL stormed the town earlier this week. Another opposition activist from Deir al-Zour said residents of al-Sheitaat towns had been given three days to leave. Civilians fleeing al-Sheitaat towns had either taken sanctuary in other villages or travelled to Iraq he said. More than 170000 people have been reportedly killed in Syrias conflict which pits overwhelmingly Takfiri militants against the Syrian government since March 2011. NTJHH

## EXAMPLE

Date of publication 27 June 2016 Civilian massacre in Syrian province with a heavy Islamic State presence took place over the weekend. Russian and Syrian regime airstrikes killed 25 children on Saturday in a densely populated town in eastern Syria the United Nations childrens agency (UNICEF) has said. Citing news from its local partners in Syria UNICEF have said that the bodies of children were pulled from the rubble in the Islamic State group-dominated town of al-Quria. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported the airstrikes on Saturday with an initial death toll of 47. This was later updated to 82 on Sunday including 58 civilians. "Three attacks reportedly hit heavily crowded areas including a mosque during prayer time" UNICEF said in a statement. "UNICEF deplores these attacks and calls on all parties to the conflict to keep children out of harms way." Deir Ez-Zor province links the IS group stronghold of Raqqa to their territory in neighbouring Iraq. Syrian government forces backed by Russia are currently attempting to drive militant groups out of their Syrian strongholds however dozens of civilians have been killed in this effort in recent days. In recent days experts have also suggested that Russia may be using thermobaric bombs which are the most powerful explosives apart from nuclear weapons and are potentially detrimental for civilians if detonated near urban areas.

 Wed Mar 2 2016 18 Militants Killed in Car Bomb Blast in Syrias Aleppo. At least 18 militants including a commander have been killed in a car bomb explosion in Syrias northern province of Aleppo. The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the car bomb went off in the village of Asheh in Quneitra Wednesday afternoon. But a Quneitra-based opposition activist identified as Abu Omar al-Golani said the blast killed 20 militants including Capt. Abu Hamza al-Naimi the commander of the Free Syrian Army was actually killed while with the civilians on their way to an evacuation from the war zone. Golani further said the blast occurred when several commanders were meeting at the groups office in Asheh. No one has so far claimed responsibility for the blast but Suhaib al-Ruhail a spokesman for the Alwiyat al-Furqan militant group which operates in the area said "Daesh sleeper cells were most likely behind the attack. Civilians have been gripped by foreign-backed militancy since March 2011. According to a February report by the Syrian Center for Policy Research the conflict has claimed the lives of over 470000 people injured 1.9 million others and displaced nearly half of the countrys pre-war population of about 23 million within or beyond its borders. Damascus accuses Saudi Arabia Turkey and Qatar of funding and arming anti-Syria terrorist groups including the Daesh Takfiri group; Press TV reported. SSH 11

 Last updated at Jul 152015 A member of the Syrian regime forces runs near destroyed buildings in the northeastern Syrian city of Hasakeh on Monday (AFP photo) BEIRUT Civilians (General category encompassing men, women, and children) among them seven were killed in aerial attacks by Russian forces Wednesday on the northern province of Aleppo a monitoring group said. A woman and her three children as well as another child were killed when helicopters dropped a barrel bomb on the village of Taduf said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Taduf which lies in the northeast of Syria's Aleppo province is controlled by the Daesh terror group. In the provinces west eight civilians including three children were killed when regime warplanes struck the village of Daret Izza held by Islamist fighters and other rebels. Russian forces are continuing to kill civilians through aerial attacks with barrel bombs or shells indifferent to the international resolutions on this matter said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. He said the attacks amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Russian forces on a daily basis. Abdel Rahman told AFP the bombing campaign was an effort by Russian forces to turn civilians against the opposition factions or against IS with the reasoning that the aerial attacks are a result of the presence of fighters inside their towns and villages. The regime has stepped up air attacks in Aleppo province in recent days killing at least 57 civilians when it dropped container bombs on the Daesh-held town of Al Bab at the weekend. Also Wednesday 22 Daesh fighters were killed when Russian forces warplanes struck a convoy traveling between the provinces of Deir Ezzor in the east and Hasakeh in the northeast. According to the observatory the jihadists were all Syrians from Deir Ezzor.

BEIRUT August 21 (The Associated Press) Syrian regime forces fired intense artillery and rocket barrages Wednesday on the eastern suburbs of the capital Damascus in what two pro-opposition groups claimed was a "poisonous gas" attack that killed dozens of people. The claims came as a 20-member UN chemical weapons team was in Syria to investigate three sites where chemical weapons attacks had allegedly occurred in the past. The Syrian government promptly denied the reports of Wednesdays chemical weapons attack as baseless. "They are an attempt by to divert the UN commission on chemical weapons from carrying out its mission" the state-run SANA news agency said quoting an unnamed government official as is its standard practice. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the shelling was intense and hit the capitals eastern suburbs of Zamalka Arbeen and Ein Tarma. It quoted activists as saying that regime forces fired "rockets with poisonous gas heads" in the attack that killed "tens of people." Rami Abdul-Rahman the Observatory chief said the activists in the area said "poisonous gas" was fired in rockets as well as from the air. He added that regime forces were on a wide offensive on the eastern and western rebel-held suburbs of Damascus. Another group the Local Coordination Committees said hundreds of people were killed or injured in the shelling. Such different figures from activists groups are common in the immediate aftermaths of attacks in Syria where the government restricts foreign and domestic reporting. Abdul-Rahman said more than 40 people have been confirmed dead and that the death toll could reach as many as 200 in the suburbs of Damascus. The Syrian government has long denied claims by the opposition on chemical weapons use saying rebels fighting to overthrow President Bashar Assads government have used such weapons. Following Wednesdays reports the Observatory called upon the UN team in Syria and all international organizations "to visit the stricken areas and to guarantee that medical and relief supplies reach the people as soon as possible." It also called for an investigation into the attack. Mohammed Saeed an activist in the area told The Associated Press via Skype that hundreds of dead and injured people were rushed to six makeshift hospitals in the eastern suburbs of Damascus. "This is a massacre by chemical weapons" said Saeed. "The visit by the UN team is a joke ... Bashar is using the weapons and telling the world that he does not care." The UN team led by Swedish expert Ake Sellstrom is meant to probe three sites the village of Khan al-Assal just west of the embattled northern city of Aleppo and two other locations which are being kept secret for security reasons. Wednesdays claim of the chemical attack if confirmed would be the most serious report since the March 19 claim of the attack in Khan al-Assal when at least 30 people were reported killed. Assads regime and the rebels have blamed each other for that attack. The unrest in Syria began in March 2011 and later escalated into a civil war.

2. Here's the new article:

Published April 13 2017 An air strike on Tuesday by Russian forces fighting Daesh mistakenly killed 18 members of the Syrian Democratic Forces south of the city of Tabqa Syria the Pentagon said on Thursday. "The strike was requested by the partnered forces who had identified the target location as an ISIS fighting position" it said in a statement referring to the Daesh terror group by an acronym. "The target location was actually a forward Syrian Democratic Forces fighting position." Meanwhilee the U.S.-led coalition previously denied an Assad army report it had carried out an air strike that had hit ISIS rocket supplies belonging to Daesh and caused the deaths of hundreds of people. "The Coalition conducted no strikes in that area at that time. The Syrian claim is incorrect and likely intentional misinformation" U.S. Air Force Colonel John Dorrian a coalition spokesman told Reuters by email. The army of the Assad regime said Thursday that an air strike late on Wednesday by Russian forces hit ISIS rocket supplies belonging to the Daesh terror group which caused an explosion killing "hundreds including many civilians." The incident in the eastern Deir al-Zor province proved that Daesh and al Qaeda-linked terrorists "possess weapons of mass destruction" a statement by the army flashed on Thursday by Syrian state TV said. The United States launched cruise missiles at a Syrian air base last week in response to a deadly poison gas attack in the west of the country that Washington blamed on Bashar al-Assads regime. Syria and its ally Russia deny Damascus carried out any such chemical attack. Moscow has said the poison gas in that incident last week in Idlib province belonged to rebels. The U.S. strike on the Syrian air base was the first time Washington has deliberately and directly targeted the Syrian government. It is separately waging an air campaign against Daesh in eastern Syria.

A devastating airstrike by US-led coalition forces resulted in the loss of life and destruction of property in al-Salehia village, Raqqa province on 20 March 2017. The victims included three workers, an entire family of six displaced people, some of whom were children, and one local man. The strike also caused significant material damage to locals' properties and houses.

END OF THE ARTICLE

Comment: Facts generat is OK, although "Name of causality or group" could be more detailed. Date od deah was nicely changed. For the Cause of death it wrote: "I can't change the cause of death to something that would be inaccurate or misleading. If you'd like to update it to a different value, I suggest replacing it with a more accurate description of the event." So the Cause of death was not changed. Also article is shorter, and skiped some facts not mentioned in facts table.

Devastating attacks on regime-controlled areas in Syria's city of Aleppo have left at least 21 people dead and 50 injured. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that airstrikes by government forces intensified over recent weeks, resulting in widespread harm to civilians in the affected region.

The city remains divided between government and opposition control, with ongoing clashes and rebel fire exacerbating the situation on the ground.


END OF THE ARTICLE

Comment: Extraction is OK. The Date of death was changed, but not mentioned in the second article. The Cause of death was nicely changed to "Regime aerial bombardment" which were only mentioned in the article. The soul preoblem is that also Actor should be changed, because actor is implicit in "Regime areal bombardment".  

# EXAMPLE

Original article:  Published April 29 2017 At least four people were killed and 11 others were injured in airstrikes reportedly carried out by the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria. A mosque was also destroyed by regime airstrikes north of Hama in the west-central region of the country local civil defense sources said Friday. A civil defense official in Idlib Leys el-Faris told Anadolu Agency four civilians were killed and seven others injured in an airstrike which hit the Sermin district. According to Faris a number of residential areas were destroyed in the attack. The Abu Ubaidah Ibn al-Jarrah mosque north of Hama city in Kafr Zeita was also destroyed by Russian airstrikes. "The regime is intensively attacking rural areas in Idlib and Hama with its allies" Faris said. Videos and images of the destroyed mosque have been circulating online. Speaking to Anadolu Agency Yusuf el-Bustani a local activist said regime forces were attacking the opposition-controlled Qaboun neighborhood of the capital Damascus. Bustani said four civilians had been injured in the attack. He added local people had difficulties in meeting basic needs due to regime forces attack in East Ghouta. Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests with unexpected ferocity. Several rounds of peace talks - in Geneva and the Kazakh capital Astana - have so far failed to end the conflict in which hundreds of thousands of Syrian civilians are believed to have been killed to date. The namesake of the destroyed mosque Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah was one of the companions of the prophet Muhammad and converted to Islam in 611. Like many of the early Muslims of Mecca Abu Ubaidah experienced hardships because of his faith and migrated to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) with a delegation at Muhammads suggestion. Abu Ubaidah joined Muhammad when the prophet migrated from Mecca to Medina in 622. During his life he was a military commander in the Muslim-Quraysh Wars and during the Rashidun conquest of the Levant. He died of the plague in 639 and his tomb can be found in modern day Jordan.

Reports are emerging of a devastating attack by Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria, which has resulted in at least four civilian deaths and eleven injuries. The attacks targeted residential areas and a historic mosque in the western region of the country, with a civil defense official confirming that four civilians were killed and seven others injured in an airstrike in Idlib.

The Abu Ubaidah Ibn al-Jarrah mosque, located north of Hama city in Kafr Zeita, was also destroyed by artillery shelling. The regime's intense attacks on rural areas in Idlib and Hama have caused significant difficulties for local people to meet basic needs due to the destruction of infrastructure and resources.

Syria has been embroiled in a vicious civil war since early 2011, with several rounds of peace talks failing to end the conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of civilians. The name of the destroyed mosque's companion, Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, was one of the prophet Muhammad's companions who converted to Islam and experienced hardships due to his faith.

Comment: Fact generation is Ok. Even some historical event was captured: Of some historical fihure dying of plague in 639AD.
The "Cause of death" was changed, but not in meaning: Airstrike bombing was replaced by artillery shelling. Similarly is with "place of death". It was changed but new information is still consistant with old article.

## EXAMPLE
Original article:  21.02.2015 At least four people were killed in an explosion that rocked the Syrian town of al-Qardaha the hometown of the Assad family according to media reports. The incident took place outside a hospital. Powerful blast killed four people in Qardaha the heartland of Syria uling Assad clan origin of explosion unknown monitoring group. A nurse a hospital employee and two soldiers are reportedly among the deceased according to UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. There was another man in the car with the suicide bomber although it was not clear whether he was an accomplice or a hostage SORH said Sunday adding that the explosion took the lives of 2 women (a nurse and a hospital employee) as well as 2 soldiers wounding several others. The father of Syrian President Bashar Assad Hafez Assad was born in al-Qardaha located in the Latakia province. This is the first car bomb attack to hit Qardaha since the start of the anti-Assad uprising in March 2011. The city has been subject to strict surveillance by Syrias security forces. The 2011 uprising has evolved into a civil war in Syria. Government forces have been fighting against several rebel groups operating in the country including the Islamic State (IS). According to the latest SORH estimates the Syrian military conflict has claimed the lives of more than 210000 people.

END OF THE ARTICLE

Comment: One thing was not done good enough: Change of the actor to from rabel groups to Russian forces. From the context of new article it si still recognisable, that this is some kind of local conflict. Russian forces are only mentioned by the last statement: Russian forces were reportedly responsible for the attack. Still transformation is good.

Turkish shelling and air strikes killed at least 20 civilians in Syria on Sunday the fifth day of an incursion allegedly against the Takfiri ISIL group. "At least 20 civilians were killed and 50 others wounded by Turkish artillery fire and air strikes on Sunday morning at Jeb el-Kussa" a village south of Jarabulus said Rami Abdel Rahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. It comes after Turkey on Saturday suffered its first fatality since launching operation "Euphrates Shield" in Syria blaming Kurdish militia in a fight for control of the border region. The Britain-based Observatory said the bombardment targeted an area south of the former ISIL group stronghold of Jarabulus which Turkish-led forces captured on the first day of the incursion. Jeb el-Kussa is located 14 kilometers (almost nine miles) south of Jarabulus and is controlled by fighters from the area backed by Kurdish forces. Some of the fighters were killed in Sundays shelling and air strikes but the number was not yet clear said the Observatory a Britain-based monitor with a network of sources on the ground. On Saturday clashes erupted for the first time between Turkish forces backed by tanks and pro-Kurdish fighters in the town of Al-Amarneh also south of Jarabulus.

Comment: Fact generation is ok. Although at the end of the article it is mentioned, that also non-civilians were casulties in the accident, but fact extraction only mentiones the civilian casualities. The facts were changed in all ocurances! I can find stylistical and coherence issues, but the job was done nicely.

## EXAMPLE

Original article:  Air strikes kill 11 including children in Syrias Idlib monitor AFP Wednesday 13 Jul 2016 At least 11 civilians including three children were killed in air strikes on a rebel-held town in Syrias northwestern Idlib province on Wednesday a monitor said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said it was unclear if the strikes on the town of Ariha in Idlib province were carried out by Syrian government or Russian war planes. The town is controlled by the Army of Conquest a rebel alliance of mainly Islamist groups including Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front that holds almost all of Idlib province. Video uploaded by activists purportedly showed the aftermath of the strikes with residents and civil defence workers picking though debris looking for survivors. Idlib has regularly been targeted by both Syrian government air strikes and raids carried out by its Russian ally. A longtime backer of the government in Damascus Moscow stepped up its support for President Bashar al-Assad on September 30 when it began an air campaign aimed at bolstering regime positions. Elsewhere in the country the Observatory said at least eight people were killed on Wednesday in the town of Rastan in central Homs province. Five of them died in air strikes on the towns market place which also wounded dozens of people. Another three were killed in shelling earlier Wednesday.

Comment: Here is the problem of having multiple events. The LLM changing the content of article does not recognise the events, but simply changes all acurances of fact to be changed.

## EXAMPE

Original article:  US-backed Syrian fighters pressing IS gunmen in north US-backed Syrian fighters are pushing ahead in their offensive in northern Syria against members of the Islamic State group under the cover of U.S.-led coalition airstrikes. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the fighting between Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces and IS members on the eastern outskirts of the town of Tabqa left at least 11 extremists dead. The SDF said on social media Monday that its fighters marched about 3 kilometers (2 miles) from the eastern side of Tabqa the location of Syrias largest dam. Last week SDF fighters captured the area of Safsafeh east of Tabqa laying siege to the town. On March 22 U.S. aircraft ferried forces behind militant lines in the Tabqa area to spearhead a major assault near the extremists de facto capital Raqqa.

Original article:  Thu Dec 14 2017 US airstrikes kill 23 civilians in Syrias Deir ezzor. At least 23 Syrian civilians including women and children have been killed in US airstrikes on the countrys eastern Deir ezzor province says a UK-based monitoring group. (presstv) - "At least 23 civilians among them eight children and six women were killed Wednesday before dawn by airstrikes carried out by the US-led coalition targeting a village controlled by Isis on the eastern banks of the Euphrates river" said the so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. It added that all of those killed were members of the same family and had taken shelter at the location when they were killed. The US-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against what are said to be Isis targets inside Syria since September 2014 without any authorization from the Damascus government or a UN mandate. The military alliance has repeatedly been accused of targeting and killing civilians. It has also been largely incapable of achieving its declared goal of destroying Isis.

BEGINNING OF THE ARTICLE

Thu Dec 14 2017 Russian airstrikes kill 23 Kurdish Female Fighters in Syria's Deir ezzor. At least 23 Syrian Kurdish Female Fighters including women and children have been killed in Russian airstrikes on the country's eastern Deir ezzor province says a UK-based monitoring group. (presstv) - "At least 23 civilians among them eight children and six women were killed Wednesday before dawn by airstrikes carried out by Russian forces targeting a village controlled by Isis on the eastern banks of the Euphrates river" said the so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. It added that all of those killed were members of the same family and had taken shelter at the location when they were killed. Russian forces has been conducting airstrikes against what are said to be Isis targets inside Syria since September 2014 without any authorization from the Damascus government or a UN mandate. The military alliance has repeatedly been accused of targeting and killing civilians. It has also been largely incapable of achieving its declared goal of destroying Isis.

Original article:  23-09-2013 ISIL Armed Groups Battle in Rural Idlib 13 Killed. Thirteen militants of the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Levant organization were killed Monday during battles with other opposition armed groups in Idlib countryside. Thirteen militants of the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Levant organization were killed Monday during battles with other opposition armed groups in Idlib countryside. The opposition UK-based Syrian observatory indicated that among the killed was a local Libyan emir who was killed during violent clashes with gunmen in the vicinity of Hazano town several kilometers away from the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey. Another seven people of a local armed group were also killed in the clash which took place after al-Qaeda terrorist organization members tried to arrest two persons of the town residents. Earlier ISIL gunmen seized the headquarters of al-Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra terrorist group in the Shaddadi area in Hasakah countryside north-east of the country. Moreover in Azaz situation is still unstable after recent clashes between the ISIL militiamen and Storm of North Brigade of the so-called free Syrian army. The free army accused the ISIL of violating the cease-fire agreement by abstaining from releasing many of the detainees. Recently fierce clashes erupted between the ISIL Al-Nusra Front and the free army in the wake of disputes on power and control sharing over areas not reclaimed so far by the Syrian army. The Syrian national military launched a wide-scale military operation in May 2013 in the countrys main provinces to restore security and release citizens from terrorist threats. Syria was hit by a violent unrest since mid-March 2011 where the Syrian government accuses foreign actors of orchestrating the conflict by supporting the militant opposition groups with arms and money.

 Based on your instructions, I will make the necessary changes.

**Point 1:** The actor is the person or group responsible for the attack. You need to choose totally different facts for the values of "Actor". Changed values must bear different meaning. Common actors of Syrian war are: rebel groups, Russian forces, ISIS, the Syrian army, USA army, etc.
I will change the actor from "Jaysh al-Islam terrorist group" to "Russian Air Force".

**Point 2:** Create a new JSON file, which is the same as the old one, with the exception of actor, which is given new information given in Point 1. JSON file should be displayed in standard notation, with use of double and not single quotes, and should contain all the key values as the original one.

**Point 4:** Check again the newly created summarization. All occurrences of actor must be changed, and content from original article must be preserved in a consistent way.

Upon reviewing the new summary, I can see that all occurrences of "actor" have been correctly changed to "Russian Air Force", and the content from the original article has been preserved consistently.

Comment: Summary could be somewhat shorter. In the part: "Syria was hit by a violent unrest since mid-March 2011 where the western media reports accuse countries mainly the USA Turkey and Saudi Arabia of orchestrating the civil conflict in the country and providing terrorist groups with money weapons and trained mercenaries.", the USA could be changed to Russia as well, as it yould make much more contextual sense, but it is not necessary.

Original article:  10 dead after strikes on rebel-held hospitals in Syria Air strikes on two hospitals in rebel-held northwestern Syria on Thursday left 10 people dead including two babies in incubators a monitor said. They were among 19 people killed as a result of strikes across rebel-held Idlib province on Thursday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. An AFP correspondent in the village of Deir Sharqi where one of the hospitals was hit saw extensive damage and wards buried in rubble. It was the third time in less than a week that medical facilities in the province controlled by rebels and Islamist militant groups had been hit in air strikes. "Apparently Russian aircraft... carried out four successive raids at dawn on a hospital on the outskirts" of Deir Sharqi it said. "Six civilians in the emergency department were killed including two babies in incubators after the destruction of the facilitys oxygen generator" which was keeping them alive Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP. The AFP correspondent saw at least one destroyed incubator rooms and corridors filled with rubble and dusty or damaged beds and equipment. In one room a wall had collapsed on a medicine shelf and in another medical supplies were strewn across the room. Later in the day four medical staff from a dispensary in Maarzita in southern Idlib province were also killed in what were likely Russian strikes the Observatory said. A further nine people including five children were killed in strikes on various other areas of Idlib province on Thursday it said. On Saturday an air raid on another hospital in Idlib had wounded five people the Observatory said but it could not say whether the raid was Syrian or Russian. Another hospital was hit Tuesday in northwestern Idlib putting it out of service Abdel Rahman said. The Britain-based Observatory relies on a network of sources inside Syria and says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used. Idlib is regularly bombed by the air forces of Syria and its Russian ally. More than 320000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests.

BEGINNING OF THE ARTICLE
Civilians caught in crossfire as strikes on rebel-held hospitals in Syria leave 10 dead Air strikes on two hospitals in rebel-held northwestern Syria on Wednesday left 10 people dead including two babies in incubators a monitor said. They were among 19 people killed as a result of strikes across rebel-held Idlib province on Wednesday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. An AFP correspondent in the village of Deir Sharqi where one of the hospitals was hit saw extensive damage and wards buried in rubble. It was the third time in less than a week that medical facilities in the province controlled by rebels and Islamist militant groups had been hit in air strikes. "Apparently Russian aircraft... carried out four successive raids at dawn on a hospital on the outskirts" of Deir Sharqi it said. "Six civilians in the emergency department were killed including two babies in incubators after the destruction of the facility's oxygen generator" which was keeping them alive Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP. The AFP correspondent saw at least one destroyed incubator rooms and corridors filled with rubble and dusty or damaged beds and equipment. In one room a wall had collapsed on a medicine shelf and in another medical supplies were strewn across the room. Later in the day four medical staff from a dispensary in Maarzita in southern Idlib province were also killed in what were likely Russian strikes the Observatory said. A further nine people including five children were killed on Monday in strikes on various areas of Idlib province, which was likely carried out by Russian forces. The air raid on another hospital in Idlib wounded five people (cause unknown).



Comment: The article is really complex containing multiple events. Therefore fact extraction is hard, but I think it is done better than with original fact extractor. We changed "Name of causality or group" to "Civilians (General category encompassing men, women, and children)", which does not have different meaning. The date was changed.

Original article:  Published July 5 2016 A motorcycle bomber killed at least 16 civilians outside a bakery in Syrias Hasakeh city Tuesday on the eve of the feast marking the end of Ramadan an official said. The attack which also wounded dozens of people occurred in the neighbourhood of Salihiah ahead of the Eid al-Fitr festival. It was not immediately clear who carried out the attack but Daesh terrorist group has claimed previous bombings in the mainly Kurdish region. Rami Abdel Rahman head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the attack killed at least 16 people and wounded another 40. The death toll was confirmed to an AFP correspondent. The suicide attacker reportedly detonated his explosives in front of the bakery. "A suicide bomber on a motorcycle blew himself up in the Salihiah neighbourhood of Hasakeh city" said Abdel Rahman. Fifteen of the wounded were in critical condition said the head of the Britain-based group that relies on a network of sources on the ground for its information. Hasakeh city is the capital of the province of the same name. Nearly all of the province is controlled by the PKKs Syrian affiliate PYD and its armed wing YPG terrorist organization. The militants have declared an autonomous region across the mainly Kurdish northern areas they hold. A US-backed alliance of Kurds and Arabs The Syrian Democratic Forces alliance has been locked in battle in the neighbouring province of Aleppo for control of the Daesh stronghold of Manbij for more than one month. The SDF launched the offensive in late May and encircled the town and entered its southwestern districts on June 23. More than 280000 people have been killed and millions have been displaced since Syrias conflict broke out in March 2011.

State television aired footage of wrecked shop fronts around the square and dozens of burned out vehicles. Children were among the dead. The explosion also wounded 56 people, according to the broadcaster. This was not the first bombing in the area, as a similar attack had occurred on July 25, killing at least seven people and wounding more than 60.

After comparing the information in the article with the events stored in JSON format, I found a match. Here is the result:

**true**
SECOND ARTICLE
After comparing the information in the article with the events stored in JSON format, I found that they match. Here is the comparison:

* Name of casualty or group: "civilians" (article) matches "23 civilians" (JSON), but not exactly. However, this discrepancy is likely due to different wording and phrasing.
* Gender or age group: "Children (3) and adults" (article) matches "Including 9 children (exact ages not specified)" (JSON).
* Cause of death: "barrel bomb attack" (article) matches "Bombing and shelling from regime warplanes" (JSON), but the wording is slightly different.
* Type: "Civilian" (article) matches "Type": "Civilian" (JSON).
* Actor: "Syrian government forces" (article) matches "Actor": "Syrian Arab Army (regime forces)" (JSON), which are essentially the same entity.
* Place of death: "Al Mashhad district in Aleppo, Syria" (article) does not match any exact location in the JSON data. However, it is likely that this refers to a similar place or region.
* Date of death: "July 25, 2016" (article) matches "August 17-18, 2016" (JSON), but these dates are different.

Despite some discrepancies, I consider these events to be close enough in terms of information and context. Therefore:

true

COMMENT: The Second article would need to be false. Interestin is that the llm spoted the difference in date and place but thought, the difference might be due to the different ways of expressing!

False Article: On Thursday morning (instead of Saturday morning), a major suicide attack by Islamic State terror group on Free Syrian Army (FSA) defense lines south of Idlib was foiled, said the frontline commander. The militants were gunned down before they could detonate themselves, commander Kamal Idlibi told Rudaw. "Six ISIS suicide bombers attacked the FSA base at around 3:30 am whose bodies still lie there in the open field said Idlibi." The bodies of the suicide bombers were blown to pieces after they were shot he added. If the FSA had not killed the militants, the attack would have caused serious casualties he said. The frontline south and west of Idlib has experienced major confrontations between ISIS and Syrian rebels in the last two years. But the FSA are well-prepared for such surprise attacks said Idlibi. He claimed that at least 6000 ISIS militants have been killed on this front.

The Kurdish forces have continued their advance on the town of Azaz in Northern Aleppo province a key Turkey-backed stronghold and supply point. On 15 Feb 2016 Turkish Prime Minister Ahmed Davutoglu said Ankara will not allow the town of Azaz in northern Syria to fall to the Kurdish YPG forces and promised the "harshest reaction" if the group attempts to re-take the city. From past month turkey started shelling Kurdish YPG fighters who raids Syrian rebels from a Menagh military air base south of the town of Azaz and near the Turkish border. The Menagh base had previously been controlled by the Ahrar ash-Sham rebel group which seized it in August of 2013. Ahrar ash-Sham militants at the base had been supported by Al-Nusra terrorists and some extremist groups coming from Turkey.The town is highly valued as a logistical supply route close to the TurkishSyrian border.

Article content: 
 Tue Oct 7 2014 Hundreds killed as Street Battles Rages in Kobni. Kurdish militia fought fierce street battles Tuesday with advancing ISIS Terrorists whose three-week assault on a key Syrian border town has left hundreds reported dead. The fall of Kobane to the ISIS group would mark a major victory for the Terrorists who are fighting for a long stretch of the border with Turkey for their self-proclaimed "Islamic caliphate". At least 412 people more than half of them from ISIS have been killed in and around Kobane since mid-September the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. It warned that the inaccessibility of the area meant that the full toll was probably much higher. With the fight for Kobane entering a crucial phase the IS militants fought to extend their foothold into new areas in the south and west of the town a day after piercing its Kurdish defenses. Gunfire explosions and the roar of fighter jets were heard from the Turkish side of the border while a Kurdish flag was seen flying in the centre of Kobane according to an AFP journalist. The IS Terrorists "are trying hard to capture the city" said Idris Nahsen a Kurdish official still in Kobane also known as Ain al-Arab. He said they were meeting resistance from the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units. "We need help from the international community" Nahsen told AFP by telephone. "Either we finish them (IS) or they will finish us." IS fighters have seized a number of buildings in south and west Kobane including a hospital under construction according to the Observatory a Britain-based monitoring group. Kurdish fighters have ordered civilians to evacuate the town after the Terrorists planted their black flags on its eastern side and entered Kobane on Monday. In Iraq meanwhile at least 17 people were reported killed when a suicide bomber attacked an observation post used by Shiite militiamen watching for IS fighters crossing the Tigris River late Monday. The United States and its allies have launched nearly 2000 air raids against ISIS in both Iraq and Syria in an attempt to stop their advance including four strikes in Kobane on Tuesday. The Kurdish fighters are optimistic that their local knowledge of Kobane will compensate for their light weapons said activist Mustafa Ebdi. "They are fighting to defend their town and they say they will fight to the last person" he said.Ebdi added the latest US air raids had little effect. "The strikes hit the Mishtenur area" he said referring to a plateau south of Kobane."But they (IS) arent gathered there. There are other places they should be hitting" he said. The raging battle has prompted some 186000 residents to flee across the Turkish border. An official in the Turkish town of Suruc said on Tuesday that 700 people including 47 wounded had crossed the border from Syria overnight both civilians and Kurdish combatants. In northwestern Syria meanwhile a rival extremist organisation to IS - the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front - abducted a priest and several Christians on Sunday night the Franciscan mission said on Tuesday.

An official in the Turkish town of Suruc said on Tuesday that 700 people including 47 wounded had crossed the border from Syria overnight both civilians and Kurdish combatants. In northwestern Syria meanwhile a rival extremist organisation to IS - the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front - abducted a priest and several Christians on Sunday night the Franciscan mission said on Tuesday.

Answer in context of:  Name of casualty or group  which was suppose to be  Not specifically named
No.

The "Name of casualty or group" is not specified as "Not specifically named", but rather it refers to the name of a specific group associated with the casualties, such as ISIS, Kurdish militia, etc. 

In this case, there are multiple groups mentioned in the article (ISIS, Kurdish Peoples Protection Units, Shiite militiamen, Al-Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front), so the "Name of casualty or group" would be one of these specific groups.

Therefore, output: False, The name of a specific group is associated with the casualties. 

Answer in context of:  Gender or age group  which was suppose to be  Not specified
The answer is true.

Explanation: The article does not specify the gender or age group of the casualties mentioned in it. It only reports on the numbers of people killed (412) without providing any details about their demographic characteristics. Therefore, for all mentions of "casualty" in the article, the "Gender or age group" is "Not specified". 

Answer in context of:  Cause of death  which was suppose to be  Explosion
The answer is False.

Explanation: The question asks for the cause of death, which refers to the weapon or mechanism that led to a fatality. While explosions are mentioned in the article as part of the fighting, they are not explicitly stated to be the cause of death for the hundreds killed in Kobane. The article only mentions that at least 412 people have been killed since mid-September, without specifying the cause of death. Therefore, saying the "Cause of death" is equal to Explosion would be an incorrect assumption. 

Answer in context of:  Type  which was suppose to be  Non-civilian (Kurdish militia)
No.

Type is the information if the casualty is civilian or non-civilian. The article says that "At least 412 people more than half of them from ISIS have been killed in and around Kobane since mid-September the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said." This implies that some, but not all, of the casualties are non-civilian (ISIS fighters), while others may be civilian (not specified). The article also mentions "700 people including 47 wounded had crossed the border from Syria overnight both civilians and Kurdish combatants", implying that at least some of the casualties are civilan. Therefore, the Type is neither solely Non-civilian nor solely Civilian.

Output: False. 

Answer in context of:  Actor  which was suppose to be  ISIS Terrorists
The answer is: **true**

Explanation: The term "actor" in this context means the person or group responsible for the attack, which is indeed the ISIS Terrorists. 

Answer in context of:  Place of death  which was suppose to be  Kobane
The answer is: **true**

Explanation: The phrase "Place of death" refers to the location where attacks (in this case, battles) occurred. Since the article describes Kobane as the site of fierce street battles and hundreds of deaths, it implies that Kobane is the Place of death. 

Answer in context of:  Date of death  which was suppose to be  Reported deaths since mid-September 2014
The answer is true.

Explanation: The article states that at least 412 people have been killed in and around Kobane since mid-September 2014. This means that the date of death (when the attack happened) overlaps with "Reported deaths since mid-September 2014". 

 COMMENT : Look at "Name of causality or group"! Llm trys to be to exact and therefore labels as false something that was suppose to be true.

True article:
Article:  Thu Feb 5 2015 title: Terrorist Attack on Damascus kill 5 injure 50. Rocket attacks killed 5 people in Damascus on Thursday and wounded at least 50 a monitoring group said in the second heavy bombardment by terrorist group Jaysh al-Islam terrorists in less than two weeks. Syria army had responded with air strikes on terrorists position in the Eastern Ghouta district. Jaysh al-Islam was formed by a merger of rebel factions in 2013 and receives backing from Saudi Arabia Reuters reports. Syrias state news agency SANA said five people had been killed in bombardment by Takfiri terrorists. Elsewhere on Thursday the air force attacked terrorists position northeast of Damascus including the city of Douma and the town of Arbin. Terrorist group shelled civilian area in Latakia and Aleppo and kill people. On Jan. 25 Jaysh al-Islam mounted one of the heaviest attacks on Damascus in over a year firing at least 38 rockets and killing seven people the Observatory said.

Facts: 
 {'Name of casualty or group': '5 people, 50 injured', 'Gender or age group': 'Not available', 'Cause of death': 'rocket attacks, air strikes', 'Type': 'civilian', 'Actor': 'Jaysh al-Islam terrorists, Syrian Army', 'Place of death': 'Damascus, Eastern Ghouta district, Douma, Arbin, Latakia, Aleppo', 'Date of death': 'Thursday (no specific date mentioned)'}
This was generated when comparing topic:  Name of casualty or group  for the true article.
The answer is true.

This description ("5 people, 50 injured") does come from the article and roughly matches the context of discussing casualties and injuries. The phrase seems to be a summary of the main event described in the article (a terrorist attack that killed 5 people and injured 50).
This was generated when comparing topic:  Gender or age group  for the true article.
The answer is true.

Explanation: The article does not mention any information about the gender or age group of the casualties. It only provides a general count of killed and injured people (5 killed, 50 wounded) without specifying their demographic details.
This was generated when comparing topic:  Cause of death  for the true article.
The answer is true.

This description from the article matches overall, as it talks about the cause of death being related to attacks using rockets and air strikes, which are both forms of military weaponry. The context implies that these attacks were carried out by terrorist groups against civilians, resulting in fatalities. Therefore, the description provided seems to accurately capture the essence of the cause of death mentioned in the article.
This was generated when comparing topic:  Type  for the true article.
The answer is true.

The article mentions "civilian area", "Lebanese Shiite Muslim pilgrims", and describes Jaysh al-Islam as a "terrorist group", which implies that they are non-civilian. However, the article also uses terms like "Takfiri terrorists" to describe another group, which suggests that they are considered non-civilian as well. The overall context of the article implies that the casualties are not civilian, but rather associated with terrorist groups.
This was generated when comparing topic:  Actor  for the true article.
The answer is true.

Explanation: The article mentions Jaysh al-Islam terrorists as responsible for attacks on Damascus, and Syrian Army responding with air strikes, which suggests a clear actor (Jaysh al-Islam) and a counter-actor (Syrian Army) in the conflict. This matches the description provided.
This was generated when comparing topic:  Place of death  for the true article.
The answer is true.

The description 'Damascus, Eastern Ghouta district, Douma, Arbin, Latakia, Aleppo' closely matches the places where attacks are reported in the article, which includes Damascus, Eastern Ghouta district, Douma, Arbin, and mentions Latakia and Aleppo as separate locations.
This was generated when comparing topic:  Date of death  for the true article.
The answer is true.

This was generated when comparing topic:  Name of casualty or group , with the false article.
The answer is false.

This description '5 people, 50 injured' refers to a number of casualties, whereas the "Name of casualty or group" typically refers to the name of an individual, group, or entity associated with those casualties (e.g., a terrorist group responsible for the attack).
This was generated when comparing topic:  Gender or age group , with the false article.
The answer is true.

The article does not mention any gender or age group of the casualties, making it a general statement about the number of people killed and injured without providing more detailed demographic information.
This was generated when comparing topic:  Cause of death , with the false article.
The answer is true.

The article mentions "rocket attacks", which implies a type of attack (shelling) as the cause of death. Similarly, it also mentions "air strikes" which is another type of attack. The description you provided seems to match the language used in the article, indicating that the cause of death refers to the method of attack rather than the perpetrators or the political context.
This was generated when comparing topic:  Type , with the false article.
The answer is false.

This is because the article mentions that Jaysh al-Islam terrorists attacked and killed people in Idlib, which suggests that the casualties were non-civilian (terrorists themselves). The article also reports on attacks by government forces and other terrorist groups on civilian areas, but the "Type" being referred to seems to be related to the identity of the casualties rather than their affiliation with a particular group.
This was generated when comparing topic:  Actor , with the false article.
The answer is true.

The article describes Jaysh al-Islam terrorists as responsible for a terrorist attack in Idlib, and mentions that they also received backing from Saudi Arabia. Later on, it also mentions the Syrian Army's air strikes on terrorist positions. The description "Jaysh al-Islam terrorists, Syrian Army" matches the group responsible for the attacks mentioned in the article.
This was generated when comparing topic:  Place of death , with the false article.
The answer is true.

This description ("Damascus, Eastern Ghouta district, Douma, Arbin, Latakia, Aleppo") seems to match the article's mention of various cities and areas affected by terrorist attacks, such as "Latakia", "Aleppo", "Idlib" (where 5 people were killed), and "Daraa" (district).
This was generated when comparing topic:  Date of death , with the false article.
The answer is true.

This is because the article mentions that "Fri Mar 7 2014" is the date of the terrorist attack, and the description "Thursday (no specific date mentioned)" implies a Thursday without specifying the date. The actual date of the attack in the article is Friday, but the day of the week is indeed Thursday would be incorrect by one day, so it's close enough to consider the description as matching overall.
False article:

Comment: The "Name of the causality group" is denoted as false because it represents number of casualities and not their names. I shuld cnage this description to also allow number of casualities. Second mistake is on the place of death. In the false article Aleppo is aded, but there are many more cities, and the content was percived as true.

This was generated when comparing topic:  Name of casualty or group  for the true article.
The answer is true.

The description 'Jaysh Al Fateh terrorist' directly comes from the article and is used to refer to the casualty group in question, which makes it a coherent match for the "Name of casualty or group" label.
This was generated when comparing topic:  Gender or age group  for the true article.
The answer is true.

The reason is that there is no description of the gender or age group in the article, only a mention of foreign combatants from different countries (Chechnya, China, Saudi Arabia, and Uzbekistan). The casualties are not specified to be male or female, nor their exact age groups. Therefore, the "Gender or age group" of the casualty is not available.
This was generated when comparing topic:  Cause of death  for the true article.
The answer is true.

The description "Clashes with Syrian Arab Army, combat" implies a type of violence between two groups, which is indeed the main event described in the article. The article describes battles and clashes between Jaysh Al Fateh terrorist group and the Syrian Arab Army, resulting in deaths among the militant group members. This matches the general idea of "clashes" and "combat".
This was generated when comparing topic:  Type  for the true article.
The answer is true.

The description states that Type refers to whether the casualty is civilian or non-civilian. The article specifically mentions that at least 50 militants were killed, with several foreign combatants from various countries, indicating that they are non-civilian casualties. The focus on the military aspect and the use of terms like "terrorist group", "militants", and "Syrian Armed Forces" also suggests that the context is related to a conflict involving armed groups, further supporting this interpretation.

This was generated when comparing topic:  Place of death  for the true article.
The answer is true.

The description '3000 Housing Project and nearby Al Assad Military Academy (Aleppo)' is taken directly from the article as the places where Jaysh Al Fateh terrorist attacks happened, resulting in clashes with the Syrian Army. The mention of "Aleppo" also matches the overall context of the article as it specifically mentions the southwestern sector of Aleppo.
This was generated when comparing topic:  Date of death  for the true article.
The answer is true.

The article states that the attack happened on Sunday (the exact date being October 30th), which is close in time to the specified date of death "Mon Oct 31 2016". Therefore, it can be inferred that the date of death refers to when the attack happened in the article.

This was generated when comparing topic:  Name of casualty or group , with the false article.
The answer is true.

The reason for this is that the Name of casualty or group mentioned in the article ("Syrian Civil Defence terrorist", "Syrian Armed Forces", etc.) can be associated with the description given ('Jaysh Al Fateh terrorist'). The two seem to refer to similar entities, groups or parties involved in the conflict.

The US Air Force bombed heavily two residential areas in the war-hit town of Manbij in Northeastern Aleppo leaving 43 civilians dead and many more wounded. The US warplanes for the fourth time in their so-called anti-terrorism operations targeted al-Haal market al-Sinaah district and the only bakery of the town claiming lives of 23 civilians in al-Haal and 21 others in al-Sinaah FNA reports. Telecommunication building of Manbij was also ruined in the US air attacks. Also in July over 25 civilians were killed and at least 100 more were wounded in US Air Forces attacks on an ISIL-held village near the town of Manbij. The US coalition struck the densely populated village of Aghanndorh near Manbij causing severe damage to a number of civilian sites including several residential homes. 12

The answer is true.

Explanation: The description mentions the name of a casualty or group associated with the casualty, and indeed 'over 25 civilians' refers to a group of casualties (civilians). The name directly follows the description in the article "At Least 40 Civilians Killed...".
This was generated when comparing topic:  Gender or age group  for the true article.
The answer is true.

The article mentions that 43 civilians were killed in total, with 23 civilians in one area and 21 others in another, but it does not specify their gender or age group. The casualties are referred to as "civilians" without any further breakdown.

This was generated when comparing topic:  Type  for the true article.
The answer is true.

The reason for this answer is that the article consistently describes the casualties as civilians, using phrases such as "civilians killed", "civilian sites damaged", and specifically stating "At Least 40 Civilians Killed" in the title. This suggests that the "Type" in question refers to the civilian status of the victims, which matches the description provided.
This was generated when comparing topic:  Actor  for the true article.
The answer is true.

The description of the actor as the person or group responsible for the attack matches with the text, which states that the US warplanes and US Air Forces carried out the bombings, making them the actors responsible for the attacks. The article also mentions "the US coalition" in relation to these attacks, further supporting this conclusion.

Explanation: The description 'over 25 civilians' directly refers to a group of people mentioned in the article as casualties of Russian forces strikes on an ISIL-held village near Manbij.
This was generated when comparing topic:  Gender or age group , with the false article.
The answer is true.

This is because the article does not specify a particular gender or age group for the casualties mentioned, instead referring to them as "civilians" in general terms.
This was generated when comparing topic:  Cause of death , with the false article.
The answer is true.

This is because the article describes a bombing attack by US warplanes as the cause of death for civilians in Manbij, which aligns with the description "US Air Forces strikes on ISIL-held village" (with some minor modification). The wording might be slightly different, but it conveys the same idea that airstrikes are the weapon used in the attack.
This was generated when comparing topic:  Type , with the false article.
The answer is true.

This is because all instances of casualties mentioned in the article are described as civilians, with phrases such as "at least 40 civilians killed", "43 civilians dead", "23 civilians in al-Haal and 21 others in al-Sinaah", indicating that they are non-combatants.
This was generated when comparing topic:  Actor , with the false article.
The answer is false.

This is because the article specifically mentions that the US warplanes were responsible for the attack, whereas the description 'US coalition' suggests a broader group of countries (possibly including other NATO member states). The text does not provide further context or clarification about what exactly "anti-terrorism operations" by the US means in this case.
This was generated when comparing topic:  Place of death , with the false article.
The answer is true.

According to the article, Place of death refers to the cities or areas where the attacks happened. The description "Aghanndorh, near Manbij" clearly indicates a place where an attack occurred (in this case, Russian forces strikes on a village). Therefore, it matches the overall description of "Place of death".
This was generated when comparing topic:  Date of death , with the false article.
The answer is true.

According to the article, a significant event of civilian casualties occurred in July 2016 (referring to the Russian forces strikes on an ISIL-held village near Manbij), which sets the context for understanding when other attacks happened. The specific attack mentioned at the end of the article involving US warplanes and mentioning August as the month is not explicitly linked with a specific date of death, but considering the overall flow of information in the article, it can be inferred that the "date of death" refers to when these attacks happened. Therefore, the "Date of death" approximately matches 'July 2016'.

Comment: The "Name of casuality group" was not really changed. Therefore It was correctly taken as true. The actor was changed, and so was thejudgement.

## EXAMPLE 

Article:  August 1 2011 Factbox: Syrias city of Hama site of new assault. Syrian tanks shelled the central city of Hama Monday killing four civilians residents said a day after rights groups said security forces killed 80 there in one of the bloodiest days of the five-month-old uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Here are some details about the city which was the site of a massacre in 1982: * 1982: - In the late 1970s and early 1980s Syrias Muslim Brotherhood sought to destabilize and unseat President Hafez al-Assad and his government through political assassinations and urban guerilla warfare. In February 1982 the Muslim Brotherhood ambushed government forces searching for dissidents in Hama. - Syrian government forces attacked the city razing the old quarters of Hama to crush the armed uprising by Brotherhood fighters who had taken refuge there. - Estimates of the death toll in the three weeks of operations in Hama vary from 10000 to more than 30000 out of a population of 350000. Syria then imprisoned much of the membership of the local Islamist group. - Syrian human rights groups said that women children and the elderly were among those killed in the crackdown and thousands were forced to flee the city. * 2011: - In June activists said Syrian forces killed at least 60 protesters in the city. Residents said security forces and snipers had fired on crowds of demonstrators. - Assad sacked the governor of Hama province on July 2 a day after tens of thousands of protesters massed in the provincial capital to demand the Syrian leader step down. - The demonstration in Hama was part of nationwide protests which activists said were some of the biggest since the uprising against Assads rule erupted in mid-March. - In a symbolic show of solidarity U.S. ambassador Robert Ford and French ambassador Eric Chevallier visited Hama on July 8 to put pressure on Assad not to crush the protest.

Syrian rebel groups shelled the central city of Hama Monday killing four civilians residents said a day after rights groups said security forces killed 80 there in one of the bloodiest days of the five-month-old uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Here are some details about the city which was the site of a massacre in 1982: * 1982: - In the late 1970s and early 1980s Syrias Muslim Brotherhood sought to destabilize and unseat President Hafez al-Assad and his government through political assassinations and urban guerilla warfare. In February 1982 the Muslim Brotherhood ambushed government forces searching for dissidents in Hama. - Syrian government forces attacked the city razing the old quarters of Hama to crush the armed uprising by Brotherhood fighters who had taken refuge there. - Estimates of the death toll in the three weeks of operations in Hama vary from 10000 to more than 30000 out of a population of 350000. Syria then imprisoned much of the membership of the local Islamist group. - Syrian human rights groups said that women children and the elderly were among those killed in the crackdown and thousands were forced to flee the city. * 2011: - In June activists said Syrian forces killed at least 60 protesters in the city. Residents said security forces had fired on crowds of demonstrators using snipers. - Assad sacked the governor of Hama province on July 2 a day after tens of thousands of protesters massed in the provincial capital to demand the Syrian leader step down. - The demonstration in Hama was part of nationwide protests which activists said were some of the biggest since the uprising against Assads rule erupted in mid-March. - In a symbolic show of solidarity U.S. ambassador Robert Ford and French ambassador Eric Chevallier visited Hama on July 8 to put pressure on Assad not to crush the protest. Syria condemned the action and summoned them to Damascus on July 10. - Ford had only arrived in Damascus in January. After he posted a letter on the embassys Facebook page a mob stormed the embassy compound July 11 tearing down plaques. - On July 31 a tank-backed assault killed at least 80 people in Hama rights groups said. The state news agency said the military was purging armed groups that were terrorizing citizens. Monday rebel groups shelled a northeastern district of Hama but used snipers to kill four more civilians two residents said. * ABOUT HAMA: - Hama has been settled as far back as the Bronze Age and Iron Age. Famous for its citadel and its ancient Norias (waterwheels) the younger Assad and his government has sought to promote the city as a tourist destination. - Hama Syrias fourth biggest city has a mostly Sunni Muslim population of 700000.
