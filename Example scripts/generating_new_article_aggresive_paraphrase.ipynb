      "Date of publication 19 October 2016 Russia has accused Belgium of killing civilians in Aleppo while partaking in coalition strikes. Tags Belgium Syria coalition air raids strikes Aleppo Russia has accused Belgium a member of a US-led coalition fighting militants in Syria of killing six civilians in airstrikes in the Aleppo region but the claim was swiftly denied by Brussels. \"Six people were killed and four people injured to various degrees as a result of bombing that destroyed two homes\" in the village of Hassajik in the Aleppo region early on Tuesday the Russian defence ministry said in a statement. \"Two of Belgiums F-16s were identified at that time in the region\" it said late Tuesday. \"There were no Russian and Syrian air force planes in this region.\" Belgian defence ministry spokeswoman Laurence Mortier denied the countrys air force was active in the area at the time. Moscow had announced on Tuesday that the Russian and Syrian air forces had stopped bombing Aleppo to pave the way for an eight-hour truce on Thursday. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova took a jab at the United States on Wednesday calling on the State Department to release statements \"strongly condemning strikes against civilian targets and the murder of civilians\". \"I think that photographs of the dead will not be difficult to find to launch an appropriate campaign on CNN\" she wrote on Facebook. The brutal government offensive against rebel-held eastern Aleppo - which has destroyed hospitals and other civilian infrastructure - has plunged Syria into some of the worst violence of the five-year war that has claimed over 300000 lives. The West has accused Russia of potential war crimes over its bombing campaign in Aleppo in support of the regime offensive. The US State Department voiced scepticism regarding Moscows planned truce while welcoming a halt in the bombardments. President Vladimir Putin is set to face Western pressure over the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine at international talks in Berlin on Wednesday as Russia comes under increasing criticism over its support for Damascus. Russian airstrikes have killed thousands of civilians since Moscow intervened in September 2015. But US-led coalition strikes have also claimed hundreds of civilian lives in parts of Syria. According to a report by the Syrian Network for Human Rights published on Wednesday coalition strikes targeting mainly IS-held areas in eastern and northern Syria have killed 649 civilians since September 2014.

      "Published September 24 2016 Ninety-two civilians were killed and 273 others injured Saturday by Assad regime and Russian airstrikes on residential areas in opposition-held parts of Syrias northwestern city of Aleppo a civil defense official said. Speaking to Anadolu Agency Najib Ansari said the warplanes targeted the districts of Bustan al-Qasr Mashhad al-Kallasa Salihiya and al-Fardos Sheikh Haider Ansar Bustan al-Basha Ard al-Hamra Sohr Tariq al-Bab Karam Hamud Mesir all of which were currently under siege by the Assad regime. The casualties include women and children. The death toll is expected to rise further due to the limited capacity to rescue victims trapped under collapsed buildings. On Friday 86 people were killed by regime and Russian warplanes. Aleppo has recently come under intense attacks by regime and Russian forces. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is \"appalled by the chilling military escalation\" in the Syrian city of Aleppo his spokesman said on Saturday. \"Since the announcement two days ago by the Assad regime of an offensive to capture eastern Aleppo there have been repeated reports of airstrikes involving the use of incendiary weapons and advanced munitions such as bunker buster bombs\" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement. Since Sept. 19 when Assad regime declared the end of the week-long cease-fire at least 359 civilians have been killed and 1407 injured by Assad regime and Russian airstrikes on Aleppo according to civil defense officials and medical sources in the city. The attacks have targeted districts in the eastern part of Aleppo besieged by regime forces. Syria has been locked in a devastating civil war since 2011 when the Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests-which had erupted as part of the Arab Spring uprisings-with unexpected ferocity. The Syrian Center for Policy Research a Beirut-based nongovernmental organization has put the death toll from the six-year-old conflict at more than 470000.\n",

      "Suicide bomber kills six in Syria restaurant Reports Suicide bombing in Aleppo restaurant at student graduation celebration kills six and wounds 19 some in critical condition says monitoring group AFP Friday 23 Aug 2013 A suicide bombing in a restaurant in Syrias second city Aleppo killed six people including a journalist from pro-government television state media and a monitoring group said Friday. The blast struck as a group of youths celebrated the graduation of a student who was one of those killed in the attack in the dining area of Mogambo on Thursday said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. \"The attack also wounded 19 people including some in critical condition\" said the Britain-based organisation. The official SANA news agency also reported the attack and singled out the death of the journalist it identified as Al-Ikhbariya TV correspondent Hassan Muhanna. The attack occurred in a part of Aleppo controlled by the regime of President Bashar al-Assad which has been fighting an armed uprising for more than two years in a conflict that has killed more than 100000. On May 27 another Al-Ikhbariya journalist was killed by a sniper in the then rebel stronghold of Qusayr. Prior to his death media watchdog Reporters Without Borders said 23 journalists had been killed in Syria since the countrys conflict erupted in March 2011.\n",

      "Sat Mar 12 2016 Turkeys Nightmare Kurds Come Closer to Azaz 6 ISIS Bombers Killed. The Kurdish forces have continued their advance on the town of Azaz in Northern Aleppo province a key Turkey-backed stronghold and supply point. On 15 Feb 2016 Turkish Prime Minister Ahmed Davutoglu said Ankara will not allow the town of Azaz in northern Syria to fall to the Kurdish YPG forces and promised the \"harshest reaction\" if the group attempts to re-take the city. From past month turkey started shelling Kurdish YPG fighters who raids Syrian rebels from a Menagh military air base south of the town of Azaz and near the Turkish border. The Menagh base had previously been controlled by the Ahrar ash-Sham rebel group which seized it in August of 2013. Ahrar ash-Sham militants at the base had been supported by Al-Nusra terrorists and some extremist groups coming from Turkey.The town is highly valued as a logistical supply route close to the TurkishSyrian border. Peshmerga shoot dead six ISIS suicide bombers west of Kirkuk In a separate event A major suicide attack by so-called Islamic State (ISIS ISIL IS Daesh ) terror Group on Peshmerga defense lines south of Kirkuk was foiled Saturday morning said the frontline commander. The militants were gunned down before they could detonate themselves commander Kamal Kirkuki told Rudaw. \"Six ISIS suicide bombers attacked the Peshmerga base at around 330 am whose bodies still lie there in the open field said Kirkuki.\" The bodies of the suicide bombers were blown to pieces after they were shot he added. If the Peshmerga had not killed the militants the attack would have caused serious casualties he said. The frontline south and west of Kirkuk has experienced major confrontations between ISIS and Kurdish forces in the last two years. But the Peshmerga are well-prepared for such surprise attacks said Kirkuki. He claimed that at least 6000 ISIS militants have been killed on this front. 12\n",

      "3 Oct 2017 At least 17 people were killed and many more injured on Monday by suicide bombings that targeted a police station in the Midan neighbourhood of Damascus the capital of Syria. Several suicide bombers believed to have been three detonated themselves in front of and inside the police station according to authorities. Local police officers learned that one of the bombers used a hand grenade to attack the police station from a viaduct before he detonated his explosive device at about 1330 on the viaduct which runs parallel to the police station. \"Previously the attacker whose identity was unknown attacked us. The terrorists outside the police station launched the attack from the viaduct. Police officers and the army unit together resisted and foiled the attack\" said Tarek a police officer. Afterward another bomber detonated his explosive device at the gate of the police station while a third bomber entered the police station and detonated his explosive device after being surrounded by police officers and an army unit. The Syrian regimes Interior Minister Mohammed Shaar told reporters that one of the attackers had managed to enter the police station and reach the first floor of the building. Daesh said three of its fighters carried out an attack on a Damascus police station on Monday. In a statement distributed on a Daesh channel via the Telegram messaging service on Tuesday the group said two of the fighters fired shots in the station before blowing themselves up. The third blew himself up later as \"reinforcements\" arrived. Local state television showed images of damage from inside the building with a black police uniform shirt covered in dust lying in the rubble of partially collapsed walls. Policemen carried one body away from the scene wrapped inside a white tarpaulin. The same police station in Midan was targeted last December when a seven-year-old female suicide bomber blew herself up inside the station. Local reactions According to a witness because the explosion occurred during working hours and the proximity of the police station to the old city of Damascus many people were killed and nearby cars houses and buildings were all destroyed. \"This is a crime. Its a terrorist act. Nobody will accept such an act. It is tragic to see the corpses on the ground. We just began having better conditions and good supplies but what about those people who lost their cars and houses?\" said a local resident. Manal a 28-year-old teacher living in Midan said she heard at least two blasts on Monday afternoon. I was coming back from work when I heard the sound of an explosion it was around 230 pm I didnt know what it was and then there was another explosion a few minutes later and buildings shook she said. Afterwards I heard gunfire which usually happens to get people to move out of the way and clear the road so ambulances can get through to retrieve the injured she added. Damascus attacks Damascus has also been rocked by occasional bomb blasts throughout the Syrian conflict including previous attacks on Midan a middle-class residential and shopping district. In December 2016 three police officers were wounded when a seven-year-old girl walked into the neighbourhoods police station wearing an explosive belt that was remotely detonated. Rebel groups have been gradually expelled from territory in the capital they once held though they maintain a presence in a handful of positions including the Jobar neighbourhood. They also hold territory in the eastern Ghouta region outside the capital and have regularly launched rockets into the city. More than 330000 people have been killed in Syria since its conflict began with protests that were met with a harsh regime crackdown. Source TRTWorld and agencies\n",

      "Tuesday 31 May 2016 18:14 Deadly Russian Airstrikes Kill 35 & Destroy Hospital in Idlib. The Syrian Coalition condemned the deadly overnight airstrikes by Russian forces on Idlib city describing the attacks as a heinous massacre and a war crime. A total of 20 rockets fired by Russian jets hit the National Hospital of Idlib residential buildings surrounding Aljalaa Park Alkastanaa roundabout area Alrawda mosque and other areas in the city late on Monday. At least 35 civilians were killed and dozens more injured in the airstrikes. Medical sources in the city said that the bombed hospital went out of service. Regime and Russian forces have lately intensified aerial bombardment on Idlib province. Two children were killed and dozens more were injured in airstrikes on Tuesday morning in the towns of Kafar Takharim Kafranbil Khan Alsibil and Saraqeb in rural Idlib. Civil defense teams said that the death toll resulting from the airstrikes in Idlib is likely to increase as many victims are still trapped under the rubble of their homes. The Turkish Foreign Ministry condemned the massacre committed by Russian aircrafts yesterday calling on the international community to assume its duty to protect civilians in Syria. On May 14 the UN Security Council expressed its outrage at attacks in Syria targeting civilians and medical facilities stressing that these attacks may amount to war crimes. Members of the Security Council reiterated their call on all parties to immediately implement in full the provisions of Security Council resolutions relating to health care in armed conflict.

      "Published June 20 2016 At least 23 DAESH members were killed Sunday in northern Syria in a Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) and U.S.-led coalition operation security sources said. Turkish artillery and coalition jets hit 33 weapons emplacements including Katyusha rockets which were reportedly preparing to attack Turkey security sources said on Monday on the condition of anonymity due to restrictions on speaking with the media. During Sundays operation 23 DAESH terrorists were killed and three buildings one defensive position and an anti-tank rocket launcher were destroyed in northern Syria the sources said. The southeastern province of Kilis has faced a spate of cross-border rocket attacks from DAESH in recent months. Kilis has been under indiscriminate rocket attacks from neighboring Syria since mid-January. Twenty people in Kilis have been killed and almost 70 others wounded by rockets that fell in the city. Syrian Arab forces have also taken territory formerly held by DAESH in a bid to capture a strategic hub linking the terrorist group with the Turkish border. The Peoples Protection Units- (YPG) dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have seized 3 kilometers of territory to the northeast of the northern city of Manbij plus 6 kilometers to the south the Pentagon said on June 9. Recognizing DAESH as a terrorist organization on Oct. 10 2013 in an official declaration Turkey continues to fight DAESH both with military precautions along the Syrian border and with extensive investigations in the country to cut off supply and recruitment routes.\n",

The UN Security Council met Wednesday to debate a Western-drafted resolution condemning the air strike. But Moscow which holds a veto defended its Damascus ally saying that while Syrian aircraft had carried out a strike the chemicals were part of a \"terrorist\" stockpile of \"toxic substances\" that had been hit on the ground.

      "19 Apr 2017 The blast happened as the regime and opposition resumed population exchanges four days after a deadly attack on a convoy of evacuees forced both sides to suspend the deal. A boy who was injured during a bomb blast on a crowded Syrian bus convoy outside Aleppo on Saturday sits inside a tent connected to Bab al-Hawa hospital near the Syrian-Turkish border Syria April 18 2017 (File photo) (TRT World and Agencies) A bomb killed six people and wounded more than 30 in Syrias second city Aleppo on Wednesday the Assad regimes official television channel reported. The blast hit the southwestern neighbourhood of Salaheddin which was on the front line between opposition and regime-held sectors before Bashar al Assads forces retook full control of the city in December. The attack took place as evacuations of civilians from conflict zones resumed after a four-day pause. About 45 buses carrying 3000 people left the opposition-besieged al-Foua and Kefraya towns of the northwestern Idlib province for regime-controlled Aleppo. Meanwhile a convoy of 11 buses left regime-besieged al-Zabadani near the capital Damascus for opposition-controlled territory a military media unit linked to the pro-regime Hezbollah group said. \"The area of Zabadani is empty of militants after the last batch of them left this morning\" the pro-regime Sham FM radio reported citing a senior regime official in Zabadani. Three buses on Wednesday also carried people who were injured in a convoy attack as they were being transferred from al-Foua and Kefraya on Saturday as well as the remains of those who had died in the attack the Hezbollah military media unit said. Saturdays convoy attack killed 126 people including more than 60 children the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The convoy was carrying at least 5000 people including civilians and several hundred pro-regime fighters who were granted safe passage out of the two towns. The attack forced a population exchange deal brokered by regime ally Iran and opposition backer Qatar to be halted. Under the deal more than 30000 people will be evacuated from four Syrian towns in two stages. Source TRTWorld and agencies\n",

      "Last updated at Jun 062016 AMMAN Nearly 50 air strikes hit rebel-held areas in and around the Syrian city of Aleppo on Sunday in some of the heaviest recent raids by Russian and Syrian government aircraft residents and a monitoring group said. The group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said an unidentified war plane had crashed in countryside south of Aleppo in an area where Islamist rebel fighters are battling the Syrian army and Iranian-backed forces. It had no information on what caused the crash. A civil defence worker said at least 32 people were killed in the rebel-held parts of the city during the air strikes with 18 bodies pulled from flattened buildings in the Qatrji neighbourhood the worst hit. The monitor said dozens of barrel bombs oil drums or cylinders packed with explosives and shrapnel were dropped by helicopter on densely populated districts. \"This week-long campaign of bombing is very intense and day by day its getting worse... it is the worst we have seen in a while\" said Bebars Mishal a civil defence official in rebel-held Aleppo. For their part rebels hit government-held areas of Aleppo in what Syrian media said was an escalation of mortar attacks on the western districts. State media said attacks on Sunday on Hamadaniyah Midan and other neighbourhoods by insurgents killed at least 20 people in the second day of intense shelling of government-held areas. The death toll over the whole weekend was at least 44. Aleppo the countrys largest city before the war has been divided for years between rebel and government-held zones. Full control of Aleppo would be a huge prize for President Bashar Assad. Russias military intervention since September has helped to bolster Assads government. In the northwestern province of Idlib meanwhile residents said Syrian and Russian jets bombed the rebel-held provincial capital setting fire to a bustling market in the heart of the city. More than 30 people were injured at least three killed and dozens were unaccounted for according to an activist contacted in the city. The Idlib strikes came just days after some of the heaviest raids on residential areas for months killing more than 30 people and injuring dozens on May 31. Idlib has been a relative haven for thousands of displaced Syrians. The air raids in Aleppo on Sunday came in the wake of strikes on civilian areas on Friday that residents said were the most intense in over a month. The Syrian Observatory said the Syrian government raids had targeted the main Castello road that leads into rebel-held Aleppo as part of a campaign to complete the encirclement of the citys insurgent-dominated areas. A Russian defence ministry statement on Sunday accused militant Syrian rebel groups of firing mortars on the mainly Kurdish-populated Sheikh Maqsood neighbourhood in Aleppo that overlooks the Castello road. The monitor said 13 people including six children were killed on Saturday in the Kurdish-run area by insurgents mortars. Rebels accuse the powerful Kurdish YPG of working with the Syrian army to cut the main artery by intensifying their ground attacks on the highway. The Russians had on Saturday accused militants from radical Islamic groups of bringing at least 1000 fighters into an area in the southern Aleppo countryside. The militants have consolidated gains since Friday in the area around the strategic town of Khan Touman rebels say. The Nusra Front spearheaded an attack on Khan Touman last month delivering one of the biggest battlefield setbacks yet to a coalition of foreign Shiite fighters supporting Syrian government forces. Rebels say Russian jets on Sunday pounded insurgent positions in the area to prevent them from advancing towards the nearby town of Hader which rebels say is a stronghold of Iranian-backed militias. Also US-backed forces on Sunday engaged with the Daesh terror groups militants in an offensive that began last Tuesday against the group-held areas in Aleppo province beginning with the Manbij area where they continued to seize more villages according to Kurdish sources and the monitor.\n",

      "Missile kills 18 civilians in Syrias Aleppo Monitor AFP Tuesday 21 Jul 2015 A missile fired by Syrian forces killed at least 18 civilians on Tuesday in a residential neighbourhood of the old quarter of Aleppo city a monitoring group said. (reuters) A missile fired by Syrian forces killed at least 18 civilians on Tuesday in a residential neighbourhood of the old quarter of Aleppo city a monitoring group said. \"The missile struck when people were still inside their homes in the Maghayir district. It killed 18 civilians including one child and wounded dozens of others\" said Rami Abdel Rahman director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. \"There are many people still stuck in the rubble and ambulances are going back and forth transporting people\" Abdel Rahman said. Photos published by his Britain-based monitoring group showed crumbling walls surrounded by a sea of dusty cinderblocks. Groups of men some wearing the white helmets of civil defence volunteers trudged through the rubble. More than 35 homes were destroyed the Observatory said. Once Syrias commercial hub Aleppo is divided between rebel groups entrenched in the east and government troops in the western neighbourhoods. It has suffered devastating damage as each side tries to dislodge the other. Rights groups have criticised both sides for indiscriminate attacks on civilians including with the regimes notorious barrel bombs. The Observatory said running water was restored Tuesday in Aleppo after a cut of more than three weeks apparently after an understanding between the regime and Al-Qaedas affiliate in Syria Al-Nusra Front. Al-Nusra which controls the pumping station in a rebel-held district had cut off supplies to pressure the government to restore electricity to areas under its control. The rebels turned the water back on after the regime caved in and restored electricity supplies according to the Observatory. Elsewhere in the war-battered country the Syrian army and its allies from Lebanons Shiite militia Hezbollah captured more territory inside Zabadani the last rebel-held town on the two countries border the Observatory said. They seized the Sahel district driving out the rebels under heavy bombardment. The two-week-old battle for Zabadani has cost the lives of at least 63 rebels and 21 Hezbollah fighters according to the Observatory which has not given a toll for the army. Syrias conflict which began in 2011 with anti-government protests has degenerated into a multi-front civil war that has killed more than 230000 people.\n",

      "Syria regime bombing kills 21 including 8 children Syrian regime bombardment and air strikes killed at least 21 civilians eight of them children in the south and northeast of the country AFP Friday 10 Oct 2014 The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitoring group said Friday 19 people including five children were killed by air strikes and surface-to-surface missiles on the Hara area in southern Daraa province. Hara is less than two kilometres (one mile) from a strategic hill in Daraa province that Al-Nusra Front jihadist rebels seized on October 5 in a battle that cost the lives of 30 regime forces and 29 insurgents. Meanwhile in northeastern Idlib province the Observatory said three children were killed and another five injured in air strikes on Tel Minis in the south. More than 180000 people have been killed in Syria since an uprising against President Bashar al-Assads regime began in 2011 escalating into a multi-sided civil war that has drawn thousands of jihadists from overseas.\n",

      "14 Nov 2017 Air strikes that ripped through a market in a rebel-held Syrian town have killed at least 61 people mostly civilians a war monitor said on Tuesday. Three strikes hit the northwestern town of Atareb on Monday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said despite a \"de-escalation zone\" in place there. \"A number of people died of their wounds bringing the toll to 61 people including five children and three policemen\" SOHR said. The Britain-based monitor said it was not clear whether the bombing raids had been carried out by Syrian government warplanes or those of its ally Russia. TRT Worlds Ahmed al Burai reports from Idlib in Syria. Air strikes on Atareb kill dozens of civilians - YouTube Air strikes were in \"de-escalation zone\" Atareb is in the west of Aleppo province in an area that is part of a \"de-escalation zone\" agreed under a deal earlier this year between the regimes allies Russia and Iran and opposition backer Turkey. The agreement is regularly violated. The zone mostly covers neighbouring Idlib province which is largely held by opposition forces and the formerly al Qaeda-affiliated Hayat Tahrir al Sham previously known as the Al Nusra Front. Despite the regimes recapture of Aleppo city late last year rebel groups maintain a presence in the west of the province. Atareb has been hit by Russian and Syrian regime air strikes since 2015 when Russia intervened in the war in Syria turning the tide in the regimes favour. The town has become home to tens of thousands of people displaced by fighting in nearby areas. Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in Syria and 11 million displaced since the conflict began in March 2011 with protests against Bashar al Assads regime.

      "Published July 5 2016 A motorcycle bomber killed at least 16 civilians outside a bakery in Syrias Hasakeh city Tuesday on the eve of the feast marking the end of Ramadan an official said. The attack which also wounded dozens of people occurred in the neighbourhood of Salihiah ahead of the Eid al-Fitr festival. It was not immediately clear who carried out the attack but Daesh terrorist group has claimed previous bombings in the mainly Kurdish region. Rami Abdel Rahman head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the attack killed at least 16 people and wounded another 40. The death toll was confirmed to an AFP correspondent. The suicide attacker reportedly detonated his explosives in front of the bakery. \"A suicide bomber on a motorcycle blew himself up in the Salihiah neighbourhood of Hasakeh city\" said Abdel Rahman. Fifteen of the wounded were in critical condition said the head of the Britain-based group that relies on a network of sources on the ground for its information. Hasakeh city is the capital of the province of the same name. Nearly all of the province is controlled by the PKKs Syrian affiliate PYD and its armed wing YPG terrorist organization. The militants have declared an autonomous region across the mainly Kurdish northern areas they hold. A US-backed alliance of Kurds and Arabs The Syrian Democratic Forces alliance has been locked in battle in the neighbouring province of Aleppo for control of the Daesh stronghold of Manbij for more than one month. The SDF launched the offensive in late May and encircled the town and entered its southwestern districts on June 23. More than 280000 people have been killed and millions have been displaced since Syrias conflict broke out in March 2011.\n",

      "April 11 2017 Russian General Staff Warns Against New US Missile Strikes on Syria. Moscow warns against new US missile strikes on Syria chief of the Russian General Staffs Main Operational Directorate Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi said at a news briefing on Tuesday. Militants are delivering toxic chemicals in Khan Shaikhoun the Jira airport East Ghouta and to the West of Aleppo the Russian General Staff said. The aim of these actions is to forge another pretext for accusing the Syrian government of using chemical weapons and for triggering new US strikes. We warn against such inadmissible steps the general staff said. The general reiterated that the Syrian army does not possess chemical weapons while the remaining two chemical weapons production and storage facilities in Syria are located on the territory controlled by the so-called armed opposition groups. We demand a thorough investigation of the alleged chemical attack by Syrian aviation on the city of Khan-Shaikhoun Rudskoi said. On April 4 a chemical weapons incident in Syrias Idlib province claimed the lives of some 80 people and inflicted harm on an additional 200 civilians. The Syrian National Coalition of Revolutionary and Opposition Forces as well as a number of Western states accused the Syrian government troops of carrying out the attack while Damascus refuted these allegations with a Syrian army source telling Sputnik that the army did not possess chemical weapons.\n",

      "12 February 2015 Free Syrian Army and Nusra Front fighters pushed from town of Deir al-Adas and surrounding areas as rebels claim Iranian-backed Lebanese group wants to set up permanent base. Hizballah fighters backed by Syrian and Iranian forces have pushed the Nusra Front and from the town of Deir al-Adas reports say in a major offensive in the Daraa governorate. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Deir al-Adas was taken on Tuesday after two days of fierce fighting between regime elements and rebels including members of Nusra al-Qaedas affiliate in Syria and fighters from the Free Syrian Army. The offensive is part of the operation launched on Sunday to seize areas at the intersection point of the three Syrian governorates of Rif Dimashq Daraa and Quneitra near the disputed Golan Heights. The observatory group said 20 opposition fighters were killed in the fighting including a Hizballah ambush near Deir al-Adas. The groups director Rami Abdulrahman told the AFP news agency that Hizballah was leading the attack on Deir al-Adas and its surrounding hills. Al-Araby al-Jadeed cannot independently verify the reports. Restoring security The official Syrian news agency Sana quoted a military source on Wednesday as saying the army was able to \"restore security\" to Sanei Tal al-Hawa and Tal-Arous in the southwestern countryside of Damascus Tal Meri west of Damascus and al-Danaji and Tal Antar near Deir al-Adas. The opposition Local Coordination Committee of Deir al-Adas said heavy shelling had forced the Free Syrian Army from the town which was now \"in range of their firepower\". Ayman al-Aasmi a member of the FSA southern front command claimed that Hizballah was trying to set up a permanent base in north Daraa to link its positions in southern Lebanon through the hills of Mount Hermon. \"The issue is not just about retaking some towns and hills\" he said. \"Hizballah pushed large forces into the battle mostly made up of Lebanese and Iraqi militias in light of the regime forces collapse in the Daraa governorate as a result of losses in battles with opposition forces defections or redeployment into the hot spots in other governorates.\" This article is an edited translation of the original Arabic.\n",

      "27 Jul 2016 At least 48 people dead over 100 injured after truck bomb exploded near security headquarters in the city of Qamishli Hasaka. A man walks by a damaged site after bomb blasts claimed by DAESH hit the northeastern Syrian city of Qamishli near the Turkish border. July 27 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) A bomb blast in the Syrian city of Qamishli on Wednesday killed 48 people and left dozens more wounded. The attack is believed to be among the deadliest in the city for years the British-based Syrian Obervatory for Human Rights said. A large truck bomb was set off near the security headquarters of the Kurdish administration that controls most of Hasaka province in the northeast said the Observatory. The death toll is expected to rise because of the number of people seriously injured added the Observatory. The official SANA news agency said at least 140 people were injured. The attack was initially believed to be a double bombing but sources in the city and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights subsequently said the initial attack caused a gas tank to detonate. My god! Look at the devastation from this terrorist attack in Qamishli. My prayers are with the victims. pic.twitter.comezhmZ1GOG4 Leith Abou Fadel (leithfadel) July 27 2016 State TV rolled footage from the scene of the blast showing large-scale damage to buildings vast amounts of rubble strewn across the road with plumes of smoke rising. The explosion was so powerful that it shattered windows in shops in the nearby Turkish town of Nusaybin which is directly across the border from where the blast occurred. Two people were slightly hurt in Nusaybin a witness said. The attack was claimed by DAESH. The assault against DAESH in the city of Manbij near the Turkish border has put it under pressure cutting off all routes out of the city. Fighters from the US-backed alliance have recently made incremental advances as they try to flush out the remaining DAESH fighters in Manbij. DAESH has previously targeted Qamishli and the provincial capital Hasaka city with bombs. A suicide blast killed six members of the Kurdish internal security force known as the Asayish in April. In July a suicide bomb killed at least 16 people in Hasaka. Kurdish forces control much of Hasaka province after capturing vast areas from the DAESH in 2015. Source TRTWorld and agencies\n",

      "Date of publication 6 June 2016 At least 17 civilians have been killed by a suspected Russian air raid in the market in the town of al-Asharah in the Deir Az-Zour province. Tags Syria air strike SOHR ISIS Deir az-Zour al-Asharah civilians Ramadan. Seventeen civilians including eight children were killed in air raids on a market in eastern Syria on Monday the first day of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights [SOHR] said the strikes on al-Asharah a town held by the Islamic State group [IS] in Deir Az-Zour province. \"The market was overcrowded on Monday because people were shopping for Ramadan\" SOHR chief Rami Abdel Rahman said in a televised interview. He said many of those killed were from the same family and that the death toll was likely to rise because of the serious condition of some of the wounded. Local activist Amir al-Huwaidi told The New Arab that the attack was most likely carried out by Russian warplanes. Heavy air raids hit IS-held areas in and outside the divided city of Deir Az-Zour from early on Monday. IS controls more than 60 percent of the city besieging an estimated 200000 people there. The Islamic militant group also controls most of the surrounding oil-rich province by the same name. The SOHR relies on a network of sources inside Syria to gather its information on the five-year conflict which has killed more than 280000 people and displaced millions. It says it determines whether strikes were carried out by Syrian Russian or US-led coalition aircraft based on the location of the raids flight patterns and the types of planes and munitions involved. Russia began carrying out strikes in Syria in September 2015 one year after the United States began its air campaign there. Regime air raids killed at least 15 civilians in the IS-held area of Boleel outside Deir az-Zour city on Friday. Read Also\n",

Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests with unexpected ferocity. More than a quarter of a million people have been killed and more than 10 million have been displaced across the war-battered country according to the United Nations.

      "Posted on April 19 2017 by Asharq Al-Awsat English Six Killed in Aleppo Bombing as Evacuation of 4 Syrian Towns Resumes Six people were killed and dozens others wounded in a blast that rocked the northern Syrian city of Aleppo at a time when a complex evacuation deal was being carried out a few kilometers away in Rashidin a southwestern suburb of the city. Syrian state TV said an explosive device went off in the northern city of Aleppo killing six people and wounding 30 others. It did not provide further details on Wednesdays blast in the regime-held Salaheddin neighborhood. Opposition media groups including Aleppo Today said the explosion occurred near a mosque during the funeral of a regime fighter. Aleppo was divided between regime and rebel-held districts for years but regime forces managed to drive rebels from the city in December with a Russian-backed offensive. Some contested areas remain. Meanwhile the widely criticized evacuation of thousands of Syrians from four besieged areas resumed Wednesday state media and activists said days after a bombing killed more than 120 evacuees and delayed the population transfer. The Central Military Media said 3000 residents of two pro-regime villages Foua and Kafarya left Wednesday in 45 buses bound for regime-controlled Aleppo. Another 11 buses carrying some 500 people including opposition fighters left Madaya and Zabadani near Damascus heading toward the northern rebel-held Idlib province. The opposition-run Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported the transfer which it said includes 800 armed men from both the rebels and regime. Some 160 mostly gunmen had remained in Zabadani. The process has resumed with 3000 people leaving Foua and Kafraya at dawn and nearly 300 leaving Zabadani and two other rebel-held areas the head of the Britain-based monitoring group Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP. Security was tightened up for Wednesdays departures. Several dozen armed rebel fighters stood guard over the marshalling area where the buses were parked. The AFP correspondent said all other vehicles were carefully searched. After repeated delays the first phase of the deal began on Friday. Some 30 hours after the first two batches reached exchange points a massive explosion struck near buses carrying evacuees from the pro-regime areas killing more than 120 mostly women and children. Many of the rebel fighters who guarded the buses were also killed. No one claimed responsibility for the attack which the regime blamed on the rebels. The transfer deal is not overseen by the United Nations. Critics say the string of evacuations which could see some 30000 people moved across battle lines over the next 60 days rewards siege tactics and amounts to forced displacement along political and sectarian lines. All four areas have been under siege for years their fate linked through a series of reciprocal agreements that the UN says have hindered aid deliveries.

      "Wed Feb 17 2016 More than 100 Terrorists Killed in Syrian Army Operations across Country. More than 100 Takfiri terrorists have been killed in two days of air and ground operations by the Syrian military across the Arab country. Syrias official news agency SANA reported on Wednesday that Syrian fighter jets targeted hideouts of the Takfiri Daesh terrorists in the town of al-Bab and several other villages in the northeastern countryside of Aleppo Province. The report said at least 70 terrorists were slain. The Syrian aircraft also dealt a heavy blow to the Takfiri militants in airstrikes on their command posts in Eastern Ghouta on the outskirts of the capital Damascus. The Syrian forces recently regained control of several areas in the same region. Also on Wednesday airstrikes by the Syrian air force targeted gathering centers of militants of the Jaish al-Fatah in Kafr Zita Jub al-Rayan and Kafr Nabudah in the northern countryside of Hama. Jaish al-Fateh terrorists suffered another blow in similar strikes on their hideouts in the province of Idlib. On Tuesday at least six Takfiri militants were killed in attacks by the Syrian ground forces in the provinces of Hama and Idlib. Separately the Syrian army released footage showing the operation of liberating two strategic villages in Aleppo. The villages of Masqan and Ehras in the northern countryside of Aleppo were liberated from the control of the Takfiri militants on Monday. The army backed by popular forces also won back the village of al-Tiba in the eastern countryside of Aleppo as well as Kafar Naya 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of Aleppo City. The Syrian army and its allies backed by Russian warplanes have recently made major advances against Takfiri militants north of Aleppo. Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi said on February 10 that the government forces will soon take full control of the militant-held areas of Aleppo but predicted a tough battle for the largest city in the Arab country. \"These battles are not easy but the day will come God willing when all Aleppo - its rural areas and the occupied part of the city - will return to state authority\" Zoubi said. Syria has been gripped by foreign-backed militancy since March 2011. According to a new report by the Syrian Center for Policy Research the conflict has claimed the lives of over 470000 people injured 1.9 million others and displaced nearly half of the countrys pre-war population of about 23 million within or beyond its borders Press TV reported.

      "Syria air strikes kill 42 including 16 children Monitor AFP Monday 22 Sep 2014 Syrian government air strikes killed at least 42 people including 16 children in Idlib province in the northwest the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Monday. The air raids on Sunday afternoon and evening killed 19 people including six children outside the city of Saraqeb and another 23 people among them 10 children in the town of Ehsim the monitoring group said. The province is largely under rebel control outside its capital Idlib city. The strikes outside Saraqeb hit an area where civilians were sheltering after fleeing repeated government air strikes on the city the Observatory said. Footage of the aftermath of the attack in Ehsim posted on YouTube by activists showed desperate civilians trying to dig out a man buried up to his neck in the rubble of a collapsed building. Another video showed the lifeless body of a child naked and covered in grey dust lying on top of shattered breeze blocks. Young men recovered the body and carried it away in a black shroud shouting \"God is greater.\"\n",

      "Saturday 20 August 2016 Syrian Coalition Urges Intl Community to Stop Crimes by Regime and Russia against Syrian Civilians. The Syrian Coalition called on the European Union the United States and friends of the Syrian people to take immediate action in order to stop crimes carried out by the Assad regime and Russia against civilians in Syria. The Assad regime backed by Russia and allied forces continues with the campaign of terror against the Syrian people. The Coalition warned that mass killings destruction and displacement by the Assad regime and its allies undermine all chances of reaching a political settlement needed to end the suffering of the Syrian people. Activists in northern rural Homs said that the Assad regime and Russian forces have recently intensified aerial attacks on rebel-held areas. At least 13 civilians were killed and 30 others wounded in airstrikes by regime and Russian fighter jets on the town of Alghantou on Friday. Airstrikes also targeted the nearby towns of Rastan Talbeesah Ter Maaleh and Zafarana. Meanwhile Albir hospital and civilian homes in the district of Alwaer in Homs were subject to intense regime shelling on Friday with reports of civilian casualties. Activists said that the Assad regime has recently resorted to spreading rumors and misinformation to instill fear among residents of the district; a tactic Russia used in Ukraine. The Coalition stressed that the barbaric crimes death and destruction the Assad regime and its allies have been wreaking in Syria will not succeed in breaking the will of the Syrian people. The coalition warned of dire consequences as a result of the international communitys continued silence over these crimes. (Source: Syrian Coalition) Twitter\n",

      "18.10.2014Get short URL 0 13 The US-led coalitions airstrikes killed 10 civilians in Syria the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says. MOSCOW October 18 (RIA Novosti) - The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced Saturday that at least 10 Syrian civilians among them children were killed by airstrikes in the US-led coalition against Islamic State (IS). According to the observatory the airstrikes targeting oil fields near the Kabiba village killed three people one under the age of 18 in the far north east Hasakah province while seven were killed by strikes targeting a gas station in a city in the eastern part of Syria Der-Ezzor. The Islamic State is a Sunni jihadi group that has been fighting the Syrian government since 2012. In June 2014 it launched an offensive in Iraq seizing vast areas in both countries and announcing the establishment of an Islamic caliphate on the territories under its control. In September US President Barack Obama announced his decision to form an international anti-IS coalition. Washington extended its airstrikes against the militants into Syria while continuing airstrikes against the groups targets in Iraq. Obama said the United States would arm and equip Kurds Iraqis and Syrias moderate opposition in an effort to eradicate the IS. ... 13 Tags Daesh airstrikes War on Terror Syrian Observatory for Human Rights Community standardsDiscussion Comment via FacebookComment via Sputnik News\n",

      "11 Oct 2016 Russian jets pounded several opposition-held parts of eastern Aleppo killing 26 people and reducing the areas to rubble. Fifteen others were killed in two more incidents of violence. The bombing by Russian jets mostly targeted several neighbourhoods in the opposition-held parts of Aleppo Syria reducing the areas to rubble. (File photo) After a lull of several days Russian jets resumed heavy bombing of eastern Aleppo on Tuesday killing 26 people. The bombing by Russian jets mostly targeted several neighbourhoods in the opposition-held parts of Aleppo reducing the areas to rubble. Up to 300000 people are still believed to be in the besieged parts of the countrys largest city. \"There is renewed bombardment and it is heavy\" Zakaria Malhifji of the Aleppo based Fastaqim opposition group told Reuters. Russia and the Syrian regime had reduced air raids in the northern city over the last week. Regime forces said it was partly to allow civilians to leave opposition-held eastern neighbourhoods. The regime previously said that opposition holed up in Aleppo can leave with their families if they lay down their arms but the opposition has denounced that offer as a deception. Regime leader Bashar al Assad vowed to completely recapture Aleppo which has been divided between the regime and opposition control since the war began in 2011. The War In Syria At least 26 people killed in eastern Aleppo following bombings by Russian jets - YouTube A brief a brief ceasefire between the Russian-backed regime and US-backed opposition groups that was mediated by Washington and Moscow collapsed last month. Children killed in school incident In another incident at least five people including children were killed when a shell belonging to opposition forces struck a school in Deraa the Britain-based Syria Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) monitoring group said. The attack left 20 others wounded the SOHR added. Control of Deraa remains divided between the Syrian regime and opposition forces. At least 10 people were also killed and another 20 wounded when a DAESH suicide bomber blew himself up in a village in northern Syria in the early hours of Tuesday the SOHR said. The blast took place in al-Mashi which is in the countryside around the city of Manbij which has been under YPG control since August.

      "Published November 23 2017 At least nine civilians were killed Thursday in airstrikes carried out by Assad regime warplanes on residential neighborhoods controlled by moderate opposition in Syrias Eastern Ghouta district a suburb of Damascus civil defense sources told Anadolu Agency. At least four civilians were killed in the city of Arbin and one was killed in each of the cities of Harasta and Douma and the towns of Mesraba Al-Hazza and Jesreen sources from Syrian civil-defense units also known as the \"White Helmets\" told Anadolu Agency anonymously due to security concerns. The airstrikes left dozens of civilians wounded who were transported to hospitals in the area the sources added. Since the beginning of last week eastern Ghouta has been under intensive strikes by regime forces that resulted in the killing of more than 70 people and injuring of many others. The Syrian regime has been stepping up its attacks on Eastern Ghouta even though the district falls within a network of de-escalation zones - endorsed by Turkey Russia and Iran - in which acts of aggression are expressly prohibited. Syria has only just begun to emerge from a devastating civil war that began in early 2011 when the Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests with unexpected ferocity. Since then hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in the fighting and more than 10 million displaced according to the UN.\n",

      "Russia says 62 Syrian troops killed in US-led strikes AFP Sunday 18 Sep 2016 More than 60 Syrian government soldiers were killed and dozens of others injured Saturday in US-led coalition air strikes on an air base in the east of the war-torn country the Russian army said. \"Warplanes from the international anti-jihadist coalition carried out four air strikes today against Syrian forces surrounded by the Islamic State group in the Deir Ezzor air base\" the army said in a statement. \"Sixty-two Syrian soldiers were killed and a hundred others were injured in these strikes.\" The Russian military said two F-16 and two A-10 jets flew into Syrian air space from neighbouring Iraq to carry out the strikes. \"Straight after the coalitions strikes IS militants launched an offensive\" said the statement adding that \"fierce fighting against the terrorists\" ensued nearby. \"If these strikes were due to an error in the target coordinates that would be a direct consequence of the US refusal to coordinate with Russia its fight against the terrorist groups in Syria\" it said. While Russian jets deployed in Syria were not operating in the area at the time of the coalition strikes they later intervened \"in support of the Syrian army by targeting IS\" Russian General Vladimir Savchenko said. \"A total of 10 strikes were carried out\" starting from 1600 GMT he said in a television briefing.\n",

      "December 19 2016 Kurd-led forces press Islamic State near Syrias Raqqa. Several villages held by Islamic State have been captured by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) a coalition of militias backed by the United States that includes a strong Kurdish contingent an organisation that monitors the war said on Monday. Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fighters walk in Tal Samin village north of Raqqa city Syria November 19 2016. REUTERS/Rodi Said The advance is part of a military campaign backed by an international coalition led by the United States to drive Islamic State from its Syrian capital of Raqqa. It follows SDF gains against the jihadist group across the north of the country. The strongest group in the SDF is the Peoples Protection Units or YPG a Kurdish militia but Washington has said that any operation to retake Raqqa should be predominantly Arab the ethnicity of most of the citys residents. The latest advances in the countryside about 50 km (30 miles) west and northwest of Raqqa follow an earlier phase of SDF gains on another front about 30 km north of the city. Three SDF soldiers were killed fighting Islamic State after the capture of five villages the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based war monitor said on Monday. Islamic State had been on the back foot in both Syria and Iraq where it is under attack in Mosul its biggest and most important possession and after a string of U.S. air strikes that have killed many of its leaders this year. However earlier this month it launched a surprise attack 160 km southwest of Raqqa to retake the ancient desert city of Palmyra which it had lost in March to Syrian army forces backed by Russian air power after a nine-month occupation. That attack demonstrated the risks still posed by the group across Syria even after its territorial losses there since mid-2015 including holdings along the Turkish border which were once its main route for supplies and recruits. Complicating the efforts against Islamic State is a second campaign being waged against it in northwest Syria by Turkey and Syrian rebel groups allied to Ankara. This has taken a large area from the jihadist group but is also aimed at stopping Kurdish expansion. The Turkish-backed Syrian rebels are now attempting to capture the city of al-Bab from Islamic State a move that will end Kurdish hopes of uniting their two separated areas of self rule in northern Syria. Early on Monday the Turkish military said one of its soldiers had been killed in a car bomb in al-Bab on Sunday and that 11 militants were also killed in clashes that day.

      "15 Aug 2016 A suicide attack near the Atmeh refugee camp in Syrias border province of Idlib kills at least 15 people. A civil defence member runs near an ambulance after an airstrike on a hospital in the town of Meles western Idlib city in opposition-held Idlib province Syria August 6 2016 (TRT World and Agencies) A suicide bomber has detonated an explosive vest on a bus in Syrias embattled Idlib province near the Atmeh border crossing killing at least 15 people and injuring 25 others some critically. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported the bus was carrying opposition fighters battling forces loyal to autocratic leader Bashar al Assads regime. Ercan Topaca the Governor of Hatay a Turkish province on the other side of the border from Idlib told Turkeys Anadolu Agency that four people injured in the blast are being treated in Turkish hospitals. He added that four other victims had died after they had been transferred to Turkish hospitals. (TRT World and Agencies) \"Some of the injured might have been evacuated to hospitals around the Atmeh refugee camp on the Syrian side but we dont have any information about the death toll. The identification process of those who lost their lives in Hatay is yet to begin\" Topaca stated. Syrias Idlib province where Atmeh is located is a major stronghold for Syrian opposition forces. The attack in Idlib came a day after heavy air strikes by Russian and regime warplanes killed 26 people and injured 11 others in the province. At least 327 people have also been killed in clashes in the neighbouring province of Aleppo. SOHR said 76 children and 41 women were among those killed in clashes over the last 15 days. The War In Syria Explosion hits Syria-Turkey border crossing Ediz Tiyansan reports - YouTube Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war which started when the Assad regime launched a violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 2011. Since then more than a quarter of a million people have been killed and around 10 million have been displaced across the war-battered country UN estimates suggest. According to the Syrian Center for Policy Research the six-year conflict has caused more than 470000 deaths in the country. Source TRTWorld and agencies\n",

Most of the victims are believed to have been killed by IS. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the number of those killed in Qaryatayn in central Homs province is likely to rise. The Observatory says most of the dead were killed during the militant groups three-week seizure of the town. Syrian troops and allied fighters regained control of the town on Saturday. The activist-run Palmyra Coordination Committee has published the names of the killed. It says at least 35 of the victims were found shot and their bodies dumped in a shaft.

Ibrahim al-Hajj a volunteer with the group said residents of the opposition-held side which is under siege could not flee and people were largely cowering inside their homes. \"Nothing about what the regime said about corridors is real nothing. How can we move on the streets if we dont feel safe. If it was real I would leave now\" says Mustafa a 48-year-old man who lives with his two elderly parents his wife and daughter. \"They want only a humanitarian corridor to get out of Aleppo they do not want anything else. They want a road to leave Aleppo\" says al-Hajj. \"People are waiting on Gods mercy.

Another showed rescuers digging out a toddler with their bare hands shouting \"God is Great\" as they lifted him from the debris. The boy showed no signs of life as he was rushed off in a rescuers arms. The airstrikes include the use of incendiary bombs and cluster munitions according to residents who blame forces loyal to the Assad regime and the Russians for the aerial attacks. \"We feel the earth trembling and shaking under our feet. Aleppo is burning\" activist Bahaa al Halabi told dpa from the besieged opposition-held districts. \"People are not safe anymore even in shelters\" resident Yassin Abu Raed said. Other residents also said the latest raids were destroying underground shelters people had built. Water stations have been badly damaged and humanitarian aid has not reached the opposition-held district in many weeks. One resident said people were eating mostly rice and lentils which had been stockpiled noting that there were few vegetables left. \"I am now going to eat my last potato\" Rami an Aleppo resident said.\n",

      "Air raids kill at least 12 civilians in Syrias Aleppo Monitor AFP Monday 17 Oct 2016 Air strikes killed at least 12 civilians in Syrias Aleppo on Monday a monitor said bringing to 45 the number killed in 24 hours of bombardment on the battleground city. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said five children were among the dead on Monday in the rebel-held district of Marjeh in east Aleppo. Dozens more people were wounded or still trapped under rubble. Of the 45 civilians killed the highest number of dead were in Qaterji where Russian raids claimed 17 lives overnight said Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. An AFP correspondent in the eastern districts said White Helmets rescuers were still working Monday morning to pull about 20 people out of the rubble in Qaterji. One civil defence volunteer said they had been unable to complete rescue missions overnight in fear of further air strikes by warplanes circling above. Both Russian and Syrian warplanes are carrying out air strikes over Aleppo in support of a major offensive by regime forces to capture rebel-held parts of the northern city. The Observatory - which relies on a network of sources inside Syria for its information - says it determines what planes carried out raids according to their type location flight patterns and the munitions involved.\n",

At least 23 Syrian civilians including women and children have been killed in US airstrikes on the countrys eastern Deir ezzor province says a UK-based monitoring group. (presstv) - \"At least 23 civilians among them eight children and six women were killed Wednesday before dawn by airstrikes carried out by the US-led coalition targeting a village controlled by Isis on the eastern banks of the Euphrates river\" said the so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. It added that all of those killed were members of the same family and had taken shelter at the location when they were killed. The US-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against what are said to be Isis targets inside Syria since September 2014 without any authorization from the Damascus government or a UN mandate. The military alliance has repeatedly been accused of targeting and killing civilians. It has also been largely incapable of achieving its declared goal of destroying Isis.

Airstrikes by US-led coalition fighter jets have killed at least 21 civilians in northern Syrian territories held by ISIL terrorists Airstrikes by US-led coalition fighter jets have killed at least 21 civilians in northern Syrian territories held by ISIL terrorists a monitoring group said. The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Monday that at least 15 people were killed as the coalition carried out raids in a northern district of Manbij city. The UK-based group which advocates the Syrian opposition said six more people lost their lives in a village near Manbij after similar attacks by coalition fighter jets. The so-called multinational task force against ISIL started its controversial mission in Iraq in late 2014 after ISIL seized control over territories west and north of the country. The United States claims the attacks are carried out to assist Syrian Kurds and Arabs fighting against ISIL in areas along the Turkish border in the province of Aleppo. However the attacks have led to numerous deaths among the civilians and Syrian military forces. The US and allies use the Incirlik air base in southern Turkey to bomb purported ISIL positions in northern Syria and Iraq. \n",

      "Date of publication 29 October 2016 Fresh fighting shook Aleppo on Saturday as rebels battled to break a siege of the city by the Syrian regime. Fresh fighting shook Aleppo on Saturday as rebels battled to break a siege of the city by the Syrian regime accused by Washington of using starvation as a weapon of war. Opposition fighters unleashed a barrage of rockets on the government-held western side of the divided city on Friday as they announced a major offensive aimed at reopening vital supply lines. \"In just a few days we will open the way for our besieged brothers\" rebel commander Abu Mustafa told AFP. The rebel fire has killed at least 21 civilians including two children according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. \"Fighting continues on the western outskirts of Aleppo where rebels have been making advances\" the British-based monitoring group which has a network of sources on the ground said Saturday. More than 1500 fighters from the provinces of Aleppo and Idlib to the west were attacking government-controlled districts of the city along a front stretching for 15 kilometres (nine miles) it said. The Observatory reported Russian air raids on Aleppos western front lines but said that a halt to Moscows aerial bombing of the rebel-held east of the city was holding. An AFP correspondent who visited Dahiyet al-Assad where rebels seized ground on Friday saw deserted streets and extensive damage to buildings as airstrikes and artillery fire hit the area. Fierce fighting shelling and car bombs killed at least 18 regime forces and allied fighters on Friday according to Observatory which was unable to provide a toll for the rebels. More than 250000 people live under government siege in the eastern half of Aleppo which the army began an operation to retake several weeks ago. Syrias second city Aleppo has been devastated by some of the heaviest fighting of the five-year civil war that began with anti-government protests and has since killed more than 300000 people. Much of the once-bustling economic hub has been reduced to rubble by air and artillery bombardment including barrel bombs - crude unguided explosive devices that cause indiscriminate damage.\n",

Fresh fighting shook Damascus on Saturday as rebels battled to break a siege of the city by the Syrian regime accused by Washington of using starvation as a weapon of war. Opposition fighters unleashed a barrage of rockets on the government-held western side of the divided city on Friday as they announced a major offensive aimed at reopening vital supply lines. \"In just a few days we will open the way for our besieged brothers\" rebel commander Abu Mustafa told AFP. The rebel fire has killed at least 21 civilians including two children according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. \"Fighting continues on the western outskirts of Damascus where rebels have been making advances\" the British-based monitoring group which has a network of sources on the ground said Saturday. More than 1500 fighters from the provinces of Damascus and Idlib to the west were attacking government-controlled districts of the city along a front stretching for 15 kilometres (nine miles) it said. The Observatory reported Russian air raids on Damascuss western front lines but said that a halt to Moscows aerial bombing of the rebel-held east of the city was holding. An AFP correspondent who visited Dahiyet al-Assad where rebels seized ground on Friday saw deserted streets and extensive damage to buildings as airstrikes and artillery fire hit the area. Fierce fighting shelling and car bombs killed at least 18 regime forces and allied fighters on Friday according to Observatory which was unable to provide a toll for the rebels. More than 250000 people live under government siege in the eastern half of Damascus which the army began an operation to retake several weeks ago. Syrias second city Damascus has been devastated by some of the heaviest fighting of the five-year civil war that began with anti-government protests and has since killed more than 300000 people. Much of the once-bustling economic hub has been reduced to rubble by air and artillery bombardment including barrel bombs - crude unguided explosive devices that cause indiscriminate damage.\n",

      "Published April 5 2017 The jet fighters from the Syrian regime have attacked settlements in the Syrian province of Idlib with chemical weapons killing at least 70 people including dozens of women and children and displaying once again the barbarity of the Bashar Assad administration. All this is happening as the so-called cease-fire is in effect in the region and the Russians are \"monitoring\" it. Idlib was the target of the regime because opposition groups and those sympathizing with them have moved out of Aleppo through an agreement brokered by Turkey and Russia. The cease-fire was supposed to have secured protection for the people of Idlib but that has been proven wrong as the regime jet fighters attacked the city with chemical bombs. Local sources reported that Syrian helicopters also attacked several settlements in the area with barrel bombs containing chemical weapons. Doctors in the town of Khan Skeikhoun in the Idlib province held by the opposition said victims started to choke vomit and faint with foam coming out of their mouths. The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said women and children were among the dozens killed with reports of \"suffocation\" by barrel bombs. The Assad regime is back to using chemical weapons. So what will the international community do in view of this monstrous atrocity? The Assad regime has done this before and after the international uproar it had \"given up\" its chemical weapons to international observers. We were told Assad did not have chemical weapons. So now that Assad is back to using these weapons it seems the international community intentionally or unintentionally simply turned a blind eye and the Assad regime simply stored the weapons to be used at a future date. The Russian mentors of the terrorist Assad who themselves face terrorist attacks in their own backyard in St. Petersburg have to see that collaborating with terrorists only brings misery and destruction. This time Assad has to be stopped. The chemical weapons Assad uses have to be taken away from him for good and he has to pay for his atrocities. Even the Russians cannot stand behind Assad as he commits these gross violations. The Americans cant simply say they are just interested in fighting Daesh and just turn a blind eye to the dangerous turn of events in Idlib. Tomorrow someone in Syria may decide to use such weapons against the U.S. forces there.Turkey is trying to create its own secure zone that Assad would never dare attack in northern Syria. But the fact that Assad is using his jet fighters and helicopters to attack even the civilians who sympathize with the Syrian opposition shows the urgent need for declaring the safe zones created by Turkey as no-fly zones. This is something that has to be looked into by the international community. The Russians can secure this zone with their air power and their ground to air S-400 missile systems thus at least offering some hope for the Syrian people trying to escape Assads atrocities.\n",

      "Original article:  Date of publication 30 September 2017 Four children are among the 28 dead in overnight airstrikes on the town of Armanaz in Idlib province purportedly carried out by Syrian regime or Russian jets. Tags Syria Russia Idlib safe zone Turkey Assad SOHR At least 28 civilians were killed in airstrikes on northwestern Syria despite a planned safe zone. Four children were among the dead in the overnight strikes on the town of Armanaz in Idlib province near the Turkish border the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based watchdog had earlier reported 12 dead in the strikes on the town in Harem district around 20 kilometres northwest of the provincial capital Idlib. Entire apartment blocks had been flattened by the bombardment an AFP correspondent said. The Observatory said it could not immediately determine whether the strikes had been carried out by jets of the Syrian regime or its ally Russia. But they are the latest in an intensifying air campaign carried out by the two governments against jihadist fighters who control most of the province and are not party to a safe zone deal brokered by Russia Turkey and Iran. The surge in bombing raids has forced hospitals in the province to close medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said on Friday. They were triggered by an offensive by jihadist fighters led by al-Qaedas former Syria affiliate launched against regime-held villages in neighbouring Hama province on September 19. The jihadists control nearly all of Idlib province after driving out Islamist former allies earlier this year. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed on Thursday to step up efforts to establish a safe zone in Idlib as part of a wider agreement struck in May. Three other safe zones have already been set up - in Eastern Ghouta near Damascus parts of the south and some areas of the central province of Homs. But in some of those areas too the fighting has continued. Shelling by the army killed at least 21 civilians in Eastern Ghouta on Saturday more than half of them children the Observatory said. The de-escalation agreement excludes both the Islamic State group and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham the alliance dominated by al-Qaedas former Syrian affiliate. The Islamic State group is under attack in its remaining strongholds in eastern Syria by both Russian-backed government forces and US-backed fighters. On Thursday it mounted a counterattack against government forces along their supply lines through the desert to the eastern city of Deir Ezzor. At least 128 troops and militia were killed on Thursday and Friday as the army battled to restore control the Observatory said. State media have reported the IS counterattack but have made no mention of the armys losses. Read Also\n",

The brutal government offensive against rebel-held eastern Aleppo - which has destroyed hospitals and other civilian infrastructure - has plunged Syria into some of the worst violence of the five-year war that has claimed over 300000 lives. The West has accused Russia of potential war crimes over its bombing campaign in Aleppo in support of the regime offensive. The US State Department voiced scepticism regarding Moscows planned truce while welcoming a halt in the bombardments. President Vladimir Putin is set to face Western pressure over the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine at international talks in Berlin on Wednesday as Russia comes under increasing criticism over its support for Damascus. Russian airstrikes have killed thousands of civilians since Moscow intervened in September 2015. But US-led coalition strikes have also claimed hundreds of civilian lives in parts of Syria.

According to a report by the Syrian Network for Human Rights published on Wednesday, October 19, 2016 coalition strikes targeting mainly IS-held areas in eastern and northern Syria have killed 649 civilians since September 2014.

      "Date of publication: 19 October 2016 Russia has accused Belgium of killing civilians in Aleppo while partaking in coalition strikes. Tags Belgium Syria coalition air raids strikes Aleppo Russia has accused Belgium a member of a US-led coalition fighting militants in Syria of killing six civilians in airstrikes in the Homs and Idlib regions but the claim was swiftly denied by Brussels. \"Six people were killed and four people injured to various degrees as a result of bombing that destroyed two homes\" in the village of Hassajik in the Homs region early on Tuesday the Russian defence ministry said in a statement. \"Two of Belgium's F-16s were identified at that time in the region\" it said late Tuesday. \"There were no Russian and Syrian air force planes in this region.\" Belgian defence ministry spokeswoman Laurence Mortier denied the country's air force was active in the area at the time. Moscow had announced on Tuesday that the Russian and Syrian air forces had stopped bombing Homs and Idlib to pave the way for an eight-hour truce on Thursday. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova took a jab at the United States on Wednesday calling on the State Department to release statements \"strongly condemning strikes against civilian targets and the murder of civilians\" caused by explosions. \"I think that photographs of the dead will not be difficult to find to launch an appropriate campaign on CNN\" she wrote on Facebook. The brutal government offensive against rebel-held eastern Aleppo - which has destroyed hospitals and other civilian infrastructure - has plunged Syria into some of the worst violence of the five-year war that has claimed over 300000 lives. The West has accused Russia of potential war crimes over its bombing campaign in Homs and Idlib in support of the regime offensive. The US State Department voiced scepticism regarding Moscow's planned truce while welcoming a halt in the bombardments.

      "Original article:  Tuesday 04 April 2017 Syrian Coalition Calls for Holding Assad Regime Accountable for Repeated Chemical Attacks. The Syrian Coalition called on the UN Security Council to hold the Assad regime accountable for the horrific crime his forces committed in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the rural Idlib at dawn today. Chemical substances were used in the attack which left at least 100 people killed and over 400 wounded mostly women and children according to the directorate of health in Idlib province. In a press release issued on Tuesday the Coalition said that early photos and videos of the aftermath of the attack clearly show a horrible crime similar to the one the Assad regime committed in eastern Ghouta near Damascus in the summer of 2013 which the international community allowed to go unpunished. The Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to hold an emergency session to address this crime and conduct an immediate investigation into it. Urgent measures need to be taken to ensure that those who ordered executed supported and are involved in the attack are held accountable under Chapter VII of the UN Charter the Coalition said. The failure to take concrete urgent action would be understood by the Assad regime as a blessing for its actions. Inaction is no more an option as it amounts to direct involvement and even direct responsibility for those crimes the Coalition added. The Assad regimes air force also carried out a massacre against civilians in the town of Douma in eastern Ghouta on Monday claiming the lives of at least 32 people including women and children. The Assad regime continues to use internationally prohibited weapons in bombing civilian areas in a blatant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and UN Security Council resolutions 2118 2209 2235 and 2254. These crimes would not have happened again had it not been for the lukewarm response by the international community and its failure to ensure protection for civilians the Coalition said. The Coalition called for the implementation of Article 21 of UN Security Council resolution 2118 which says the Council would take measures under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter in case of noncompliance including the transfer and use of chemical weapons.

Another 30 moderate fighters were injured due to the latest clashes. Turkish backed-moderate groups hit 63 Daish targets after determining them via surveillance devices on Monday. Several weapons equipment six full armed pick-up like vehicles a supplies-laden truck seven Katyusha rocket launchers three settlements all of which belonged to the Daish terrorist organization were destroyed in the operation. Turkish warplanes carried out airstrikes against Daish in the area of Akhtarin Turkmen Bari and Dabiq of northern Syria and destroyed nine Daish targets with ten bombs. Nine buildings used by the terrorists as a base for command head weapon emplacement and an ammunition depot were also destroyed. Meanwhile moderate groups organized 11 airstrike operations against Daish in the area of Ziyadiyah Bahrutah Duvaybik Aktharin and Turkmen Bari in northern Syria. 13 elements of the terrorist group including four buildings three vehicles and a mortar were destroyed. On Sunday three rockets fired from a Daish-controlled area in Syria hit the border city of Kilis one police officer killed and two injured. Turkish howitzers responded with artillery fire to the rockets military sources said. An area of 960 square kilometers in northern Syria have been taken under control so far in the counter-terror operation called Operations Euphrates Shield that was started by Turkish backed-Syrian moderate groups on August 24 to secure the northern Syria from regional terror groups such as the PKKs Syrian branches the PYD YPG and Daish. Turkish military since the beginning of operation have been taking significant precautions neither to allow the Syrian civilians hurt nor Syrian cities damaged during clashes with terror groups.\n",

The Syrian Network for Human Rights said in a report released today that ISIS had forced at least 33000 residents out of their homes in the town of Abu Hamam in rural Deir Ezzor since 10 August 2014. According to report ISIS has executed around 367 people in the town while 240 more have gone missing. The Syrian Coalition has previously condemned the heinous crime committed by ISIS in eastern rural Deir Ezzor where residents discovered a mass grave containing 230 corpses of tribesmen who were summarily executed by ISIS in late 2014. The area was the scene of fierce battles between the Shaitat tribesmen and ISIS militants who eventually took control of the area and rounded up hundreds of tribesmen and executed them on charges of apostasy. The Syrian Coalition stresses that modern dictatorships have left nothing but a legacy of mass graves death and destruction. Four years have passed since Assad embarked on his brutal campaign on the Syrian people and now ISIS to pursue the same campaign and one can hardly find any difference between the two in terms of the scale of their criminality and barbarity. Despite the unprecedented sacrifices Syrians are determined to move forward in their revolution with the aim of building a state justice law freedom and dignity for all its citizens.

Tags Syria Aleppo Azaz Rebels Car Bomb Islamic State At least 20 people were killed in a car bomb blast at an opposition checkpoint in the northern Syrian province of Aleppo on Thursday local sources said. The blast hit near the town of Azaz close to the border with Turkey local activist Mohammad al-Halabi told The New Arab adding that rebels manning the checkpoint and civilians waiting to get through were killed. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 14 of the dead were rebels. The attack also injured dozens and the monitor said the toll could rise further because of the number of people with serious wounds. The checkpoint was run by the Shamiya Front rebel group which is active in Aleppo province and was on the road to the Bab al-Salama crossing. The blast caused huge devastation and most of the injured were taken across the border to the nearby Turkish hospitals Mohammad al-Halabi added. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack which al-Halabi believes bares the hallmarks of the Islamic State group. IS has regularly targeted rebel factions with bomb attacks including an October 6 attack at a border crossing in neighbouring Idlib province that killed 29 rebels. More than 300000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began with anti-government protests in March 2011.\n",

Smoke rises after an airstrike in the opposition-held town of Dael in Deraa Governorate Syria September 5 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) A fragile ceasefire between Bashar al Assads regime and Syrian opposition forces that was brokered by the US and Russia last week has ended with no word of a renewed truce on Monday. From the outset the week-long truce was marred by violations. Regime helicopters dropped four barrel bombs on an opposition-held town of Dael in the southern province of Daraa killing 10 people including a child the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported. People move an injured man inside a field hospital after an airstrike in the opposition-held town of Dael in Daraa Governorate Syria September 18 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) Airstrikes were also reported in Aleppo Syrias largest city and former commercial hub. There was no confirmation as to whether or not the Syrian regime or its allied Russian airforce both of which have oversight of Syrian airspace were responsible. The incidents came just a day after US-led coalition forces killed dozens of regime fighters south of Deir al Zor after mistaking them for DAESH terrorists triggering criticism from Moscow. The War In Syria Interview with Alexey Khlebnikov from Russia Direct on US strikes on regime forces - YouTube Russia has backed the Assad regime since the war in Syria began in 2011 while the US has long called on Assad to step down. The superpowers have been targeting DAESH with parallel military campaigns in Syria forcing the terrorist group to retreat from swathes of land it took control of across the country in 2013 and 2014. But the Syrian war has placed Washington and Moscow at loggerheads with Russia seeking to prop up the regime while US-led coalition airstrikes on DAESH aim to pave the way for US-backed groups to take control. Russian Sukhoi Su-34 fighter-bomber dropping off bombs in the Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor. (Reuters) Ceasefire failed and ended A number of violations on both sides have threatened the ceasefire. Zakaria Malahifji head of the political office of the Aleppo-based opposition group Fastaqim told Reuters he believed the truce had \"practically failed and has ended.\" Malahifji also expressed doubt that UN aid trucks stuck on the Turkish border would reach besieged areas of eastern Aleppo. \"There is no hope. It has been a number of days of procrastination. Every day there is a pretext. There is no hope of aid being delivered currently\" he said. Up to 300000 people in the opposition-held parts of Aleppo are running low on vital supplies due to siege by the regime which is yet to give permission to the 20-vehicle convoy waiting in the Turkish city of Gaziantep permission to cross into Syria.

Both sides have laid the blame on each other for ceasefire violations. On Sunday Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Major-General Igor Konashenkov in an emailed statement accused \"terrorists and the opposition\" of using the ceasefire to \"boost their forces and prepare for renewed hostilities\". Russia has also called for an emergency UN Security Council meeting after claiming over 60 regime fighters were killed by the US-led airstrikes on Saturday. The War In Syria Interview with Richard Weitz from Hudson Institute on incendiary strikes in Syria - YouTube In turn US Secretary of State John Kerry called on Russia to \"stop the grandstanding stop the showboating and get the humanitarian assistance going.\" \"Russias client Russias supported friend is the single biggest blockade to the ability to move forward here\" Kerry told CNN in reference to the regimes failure to grant access to the UN aid convoy.

Government helicopters dropped the crude and indiscriminate weapons on al-Bab which lies in the northern province of Aleppo and is held by the extremist Islamic State group according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Since Saturday at least 68 civilians have been killed in aerial attacks on the town. Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP the \"intensified air attacks by regime forces on al-Bab are aimed at foiling IS efforts on multiple fronts\" including the nearby Kweyris military airport which IS has besieged for more than a year. Al-Bab is strategically important because it is one of ISs closest positions to regime-held parts of Aleppo he said. In May more than 60 civilians were killed by barrel bomb attacks on the town. Syrias embattled regime has heavily bombarded areas in Aleppo province that have fallen out of its control. To the west in Idlib province an alliance of rebels and Islamist fighters carried heavily shelled the provinces last two regime-held Shia villages for the second consecutive day.

Abdel Rahman said there were casualties but had no immediate toll. The Army of Conquest said Wednesday its attack was a response to an offensive by the army and the Lebanese Shia movement Hezbollah on Zabadani the last rebel-held bastion along the Syrian-Lebanese border. Clashes in Zabadani raged on Thursday according to the Observatory which has documented heavy shelling on the town since early July.

      "TWICE EXTRACTED ARTICLE:  April 25, 2016 At least 11 civilians including three children were killed in regime barrel bomb attacks in the town of al-Bab held by the extremist Islamic State group a monitoring group said. Tags Syria Islamic State group IS civilians barrel bombs Syrian Observatory for Human Rights At least 11 Civilians in Refugee Camps among them three children were killed Monday in regime barrel bomb attacks on an extremist-held town in northern Syria a monitoring group said. Government helicopters dropped the crude and indiscriminate weapons on al-Bab which lies in the northern province of Aleppo and is held by the extremist Islamic State group according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Since last Thursday at least 68 civilians have been killed in aerial attacks on the town. Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP the \"intensified air attacks by regime forces on al-Bab are aimed at foiling IS efforts on multiple fronts\" including the nearby Kweyris military airport which IS has besieged for more than a year. Al-Bab is strategically important because it is one of ISs closest positions to regime-held parts of Aleppo he said. In May more than 60 civilians were killed by barrel bomb attacks on the town. Syrias embattled regime has heavily bombarded areas in Aleppo province that have fallen out of its control. To the west in Idlib province an alliance of rebels and Islamist fighters carried heavily shelled the provinces last two regime-held Shia villages for the second consecutive day. The \"Army of Conquest\" an opposition coalition that includes al-Qaedas Syria affiliate al-Nusra Front began its assault on Fuaa and Kafraya on Wednesday. \"Dozens of shells fell overnight Wednesday and into Thursday morning on Fuaa and Kafraya which are largely inhabited by Shia Muslims\" the Observatory said. Abdel Rahman said there were casualties but had no immediate toll. The Army of Conquest said Wednesday its attack was a response to an offensive by the army and the Lebanese Shia movement Hezbollah on Zabadani the last rebel-held bastion along the Syrian-Lebanese border.

      "Original article:  2 May 2017 At least 24 people were killed on Tuesday in a Daesh attack near a refugee camp on the Syrian side of the border with Iraq a Britain-based war monitor said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said militants sneaked into the village of Rajm Sleibi which houses the camp for the displaced people fleeing Daesh-held areas in Syria and Iraq. The village lies in Hasakeh province a frontline that separates the area from Daesh-held places further south. \"At least five suicide attackers blew themselves up outside and inside a camp for Iraqi refugees and displaced Syrians in Hasakeh province\" Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. The dead included displaced children. Heavy clashes then erupted between the Daesh fighters and members of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters some of whose combatants were among the dead Abdel Rahman said. The SDF is dominated by the YPG which is the armed wing of the PYD a Syrian affiliate of the PKK listed as a terrorist organisation by Turkey the US and EU. Redur Khalil one of the spokespersons within SDF said the attack came a few hours after Daesh suicide bombers dressed in civilian clothes entered the town of Shaddadeh and engaged SDF forces triggering clashes. Daesh is under attack by an array of forces in Syria and Iraq. In Syria the SDF is now fighting to recapture the town of Tabqa from the group. Tabqa is an important stronghold for the militants located about 40 kilometres (25 miles) southeast of Daeshs de facto capital the city of Raqqa. In Iraq the extremist group is fighting for survival against Iraqi forces and their allies in the last neighbourhoods it still holds in the western part of Mosul Iraqs second largest city. Chemical attacks Human Rights Watch on Monday accused Syrian government forces of likely dropping bombs containing nerve agents at least three times elsewhere in the country before an April 4 attack that killed dozens of people and sparked a retaliatory US strike. Bashar al Assads forces are also stepping up chlorine gas attacks and have begun using surface-fired rockets filled with chlorine in fighting near Damascus the US-based rights group said in a new report. \"The governments use of nerve agents is a deadly escalation and part of a clear pattern\" said Kenneth Roth Human Rights Watchs executive director. \"In the last six months the government has used warplanes helicopters and ground forces to deliver chlorine and sarin in Damascus Hama Idlib and Aleppo.\" The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical weapons a global watchdog has said sarin or a similar banned toxin was used in the April 4 strike. Human Rights Watch said that before the April 4 attack on Khan Shaykhun government warplanes also appeared to have dropped nerve agents on eastern Hama on December 11 and 12 2016 and northern Hama near Khan Shaykhun on March 30 2017. Three suspected attacks in Hama Human Rights Watch said 64 people died from exposure to nerve agents after warplanes attacked territory controlled by Daesh in eastern Hama on December 11 and December 12. Activists and local residents provided names of the victims while Human Rights Watch interviewed four witnesses and two medical personnel about the alleged attacks. A third suspected nerve agent attack in northern Hama on March 30 caused no deaths but injured dozens of civilians and combatants according to residents and medical personnel the report said. The alleged attacks were systematic and in some cases directed against civilians which would meet the legal criteria to be characterised as crimes against humanity the rights group said. Syrian regime denies accusations The Syrian regime has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons. The Syrian UN mission was not immediately available to comment on the allegations by Human Rights Watch which cited interviews with witnesses and medical personnel. Last month Assad told AFP in an interview that the suspected sarin attack in Khan Shaykhun was \"100 percent\" fabricated serving as a pretext for US missile strikes on a Syrian airfield.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said militants sneaked into the village of Rajm Sleibi which houses the camp for the displaced people fleeing Daesh-held areas in Syria and Iraq. The village lies in Hasakeh province a frontline that separates the area from Daesh-held places further south. \"At least five suicide attackers blew themselves up outside and inside a camp for Iraqi refugees and displaced Syrians in Aleppo\" Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. The dead included displaced children. Heavy clashes then erupted between the Daesh fighters and members of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters some of whose combatants were among the dead Abdel Rahman said. The SDF is dominated by the YPG which is the armed wing of the PYD a Syrian affiliate of the PKK listed as a terrorist organisation by Turkey the US and EU. Redur Khalil one of the spokespersons within SDF said the attack came a few hours after Daesh suicide bombers dressed in civilian clothes entered the town of Shaddadeh and engaged SDF forces triggering clashes. Daesh is under attack by an array of forces in Syria and Iraq. In Syria the SDF is now fighting to recapture the town of Tabqa from the group. Tabqa is an important stronghold for the militants located about 40 kilometres (25 miles) southeast of Daeshs de facto capital the city of Raqqa. In Iraq the extremist group is fighting for survival against Iraqi forces and their allies in the last neighbourhoods it still holds in the western part of Mosul Iraqs second largest city. Chemical attacks Human Rights Watch on Monday accused Syrian government forces of likely dropping bombs containing nerve agents at least three times elsewhere in the country before an April 4 attack that killed dozens of people and sparked a retaliatory US strike. Bashar al Assads forces are also stepping up chlorine gas attacks and have begun using surface-fired rockets filled with chlorine in fighting near Aleppo the US-based rights group said in a new report. \"The governments use of nerve agents is a deadly escalation and part of a clear pattern\" said Kenneth Roth Human Rights Watchs executive director. \"In the last six months the government has used warplanes helicopters and ground forces to deliver chlorine and sarin in Damascus Hama Idlib and Aleppo.\" The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical weapons a global watchdog has said sarin or a similar banned toxin was used in the April 4 strike. Human Rights Watch said that before the April 4 attack on Khan Shaykhun government warplanes also appeared to have dropped nerve agents on eastern Hama on December 11 and 12 2016 and northern Hama near Khan Shaykhun on March 30 2017. Three suspected attacks in Hama Human Rights Watch said 64 people died from exposure to nerve agents after warplanes attacked territory controlled by Daesh in Aleppo. The rights group accused the government of using banned chemicals to kill civilians and fighters alike.\n",

      "Original article:  19 Apr 2017 The blast happened as the regime and opposition resumed population exchanges four days after a deadly attack on a convoy of evacuees forced both sides to suspend the deal. A boy who was injured during a bomb blast on a crowded Syrian bus convoy outside Aleppo on Saturday sits inside a tent connected to Bab al-Hawa hospital near the Syrian-Turkish border Syria April 18 2017 (File photo) (TRT World and Agencies) A bomb killed six people and wounded more than 30 in Syrias second city Aleppo on Wednesday the Assad regimes official television channel reported. The blast hit the southwestern neighbourhood of Salaheddin which was on the front line between opposition and regime-held sectors before Bashar al Assads forces retook full control of the city in December. The attack took place as evacuations of civilians from conflict zones resumed after a four-day pause. About 45 buses carrying 3000 people left the opposition-besieged al-Foua and Kefraya towns of the northwestern Idlib province for regime-controlled Aleppo. Meanwhile a convoy of 11 buses left regime-besieged al-Zabadani near the capital Damascus for opposition-controlled territory a military media unit linked to the pro-regime Hezbollah group said. \"The area of Zabadani is empty of militants after the last batch of them left this morning\" the pro-regime Sham FM radio reported citing a senior regime official in Zabadani. Three buses on Wednesday also carried people who were injured in a convoy attack as they were being transferred from al-Foua and Kefraya on Saturday as well as the remains of those who had died in the attack the Hezbollah military media unit said. Saturdays convoy attack killed 126 people including more than 60 children the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The convoy was carrying at least 5000 people including civilians and several hundred pro-regime fighters who were granted safe passage out of the two towns. The attack forced a population exchange deal brokered by regime ally Iran and opposition backer Qatar to be halted. Under the deal more than 30000 people will be evacuated from four Syrian towns in two stages. Source TRTWorld and agencies\n",

      "Original article:  10-07-2016 Syrian Forces Foil Raid on Castello Kill 29 Militants. Nearly 30 foreign-sponsored Takfiri terrorists have been killed in an offensive they had unsuccessfully launched to reopen a key supply route into the Syrian northern city of Aleppo Nearly 30 foreign-sponsored Takfiri terrorists have been killed in an offensive they had unsuccessfully launched to reopen a key supply route into the Syrian northern city of Aleppo. The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced on Sunday that militants from the so-called Faylaq al-Sham and Nusra Front the latter of which is the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda mounted an attack to recapture the strategic Castello Road on Thursday. It added that Syrian army soldiers launched a counter-offensive killing 29 extremists and foiling their attack. The attack has ended and the road remains completely closed said Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman. The Castello Road was effectively severed by Syrian forces Thursday when they seized a hilltop within firing range of the key supply route. By Saturday the army soldiers were within 500 meters (yards) of the road and firing on any vehicle attempting to use it. The Observatory said at least one car had been targeted on the road early Sunday morning adding it was unclear if it was carrying civilians or fighters. The capture of the Castello Road came in the wake of recent advances by the Syrian army in the al-Mallah Farms area northwest of Aleppo. The army had been attempting to seize Mallah for more than two years as it runs adjacent to the Castello Road the last route militants can use to access districts they control in the second Syrian city. The capture of Mallah Farms and Castello Road enables Syrian forces to besiege militant-held neighborhoods of Aleppo and puts them within the firing range of the army. \n",

Many pointed their fingers at the Syrian regime which denied any responsibility for the attack and described the massacre as fabricated fake accusations by the armed fighters. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the attack believed to have been carried out by Syrian regime or Russian jets killed at least 58 people including 11 children at ages below 8. The Observatory added that warplanes continued to bomb the town following the attack which took place near a medical center where the victims of the first aggression were being treated. The attack also caused many people to choke and some to foam at the mouth the Observatory added. A high-ranking Syrian opposition official told Asharq Al-Awsat that the gas used during Tuesdays massacre had never been used before. Director of Levant Institute for Strategic Affairs (LISA) Sami Nader said. This crime will constitute a turning point in the Syrian developments because it has embarrassed the Russians on the issue of chemicals. Meanwhile the National Coalition for Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces said the attack killed more than 100 people including 25 children and 15 women and injured 400 others. A military source at the Free Syrian Army told Asharq Al-Awsat that the attack targeted a popular market in the center of Khan Sheikhoun. The attack only targeted civilians in order to push the residents of Idlib and its suburbs to migrate outside the Syrian border the source asserted. While UN war crimes investigators are looking into the alleged chemical weapons attack on the Syrian town in Idlib the Security Council is expected to hold a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the matter. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it is seriously concerned about the attack. It said its Fact Finding Mission (FFM) is in the process of gathering and analyzing information from all available sources. Several countries also condemned the attack. The White House considered it as unacceptable while US President Donald Trump said These heinous actions by the Bashar Assad regime are a consequence of the past administrations weakness and irresolution.For his part French President Francois Hollande directly blamed Syrian regime forces for the attack while High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini said the regime of Assad bears primary responsibility.Commenting on what happened in Khan Sheikhoun UN special envoy for Syria Staffa de Mistura said This was horrific im sure there will be a Security Council meeting on this for clear identification of responsibilities accountability.

      "Original article:  August 21 2013 Activists say more than 200 killed in gas attack near Damascus. Dominic Evans Khaled Yacoub Oweis. Syrian activists accused President Bashar al-Assads forces of launching a nerve gas attack that killed at least 213 people on Wednesday in what would if confirmed be by far the worst reported use of poison gas in the two-year-old civil war. Reuters was not able to verify the accounts independently and they were denied by Syrian state television which said they were disseminated deliberately to distract a team of United Nations chemical weapons experts which arrived three days ago. The U.N. team is in Syria investigating allegations that both rebels and army forces used poison gas in the past one of the main disputes in international diplomacy over Syria. Activists said rockets with chemical agents hit the Damascus suburbs of Ain Tarma Zamalka and Jobar before dawn. A nurse at Douma Emergency Collection facility Bayan Baker said the death toll as collated from medical centers in the suburbs east of Damascus was 213. Many of the casualties are women and children. They arrived with their pupil dilated cold limbs and foam in their mouths. The doctors say these are typical symptoms of nerve gas victims the nurse said. Extensive amateur video and photographs purporting to show victims appeared on the Internet. A video purportedly shot in the Kafr Batna neighborhood showed a room filled with more than 90 bodies many of them children and a few women and elderly men. Most of the bodies appeared ashen or pale but with no visible injuries. About a dozen were wrapped in blankets. Other footage showed doctors treating people in makeshift clinics. One video showed the bodies of a dozen people lying on the floor of a clinic with no visible wounds. The narrator in the video said they were all members of a single family. In a corridor outside lay another five bodies. A photograph taken by activists in Douma showed the bodies of at least 16 children and three adults one wearing combat fatigues laid at the floor of a room in a medical facility where bodies were collected. Syrian state television quoted a source as saying there was no truth whatsoever to the reports. Syria is one of just a handful of countries that are not parties to the international treaty that bans chemical weapons and Western nations believe it has caches of undeclared mustard gas sarin and VX nerve agents. A youth affected by what activists say is nerve gas is treated at a hospital in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus August 21 2013. REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh Assads officials have said they would never use poison gas - if they had it - against Syrians. The United States and European allies believe Assads forces used small amounts of sarin gas in attacks in the past which Washington called a red line that justified international military aid for the rebels. Assads government has responded in the past with accusations that it was the rebels that used chemical weapons which the rebels deny. Western countries say they do not believe the rebels have access to poison gas. Assads main global ally Moscow says accusations on both sides must be investigated. Khaled Omar of the opposition Local Council in Ain Tarma said he saw at least 80 bodies at the Hajjah Hospital in Ain Tarma and at a makeshift clinic at Tatbiqiya School in the nearby district of Saqba. Slideshow (3 Images) The attack took place at around 3:00 a.m. (0000 GMT / 8:00 p.m. Tuesday EDT). Most of those killed were in their homes Omar said. SURPRISING TIMING The timing and location of the reported chemical weapons use - just three days after the team of U.N. chemical experts checked in to a Damascus hotel a few km (miles) to the east at the start of their mission - was surprising. Logically it would make little sense for the Syrian government to employ chemical agents at such a time particularly given the relatively close proximity of the targeted towns (to the U.N. team) said Charles Lister analysts at IHS Janes Terrorism and Insurgency Center. Nonetheless the Ghouta region (where the attacks were reported) is well known for its opposition leanings. Jabhat al-Nusra has had a long-time presence there and the region has borne the brunt of sustained military pressure for months now he said referring to a hardline Sunni Islamist rebel group allied to al Qaeda. While it is clearly impossible to confirm the chemical weapons claim it is clear from videos uploaded by reliable accounts that a large number of people have died. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitoring group said dozens of people were killed including children in fierce bombardment. It said Mouadamiya southwest of the capital came under the heaviest attack since the start of the two-year conflict. The Observatory called on the U.N. experts and international organizations to visit the affected areas to ensure aid could be delivered and to launch an investigation to determine who was responsible for the bombardment and hold them to account.

      "Original article:  15 July 2015 Abu Abdelrahman Salqeen leader of Syrian rebel group Ahrar al-Sham was killed Tuesday in a suicide bombing that targeted the group for the second time in less than a year. Tags Syria Ahrar al-Sham Nusra Front suicide bombing Staffan De Mistura Southern Front alliance regime forces Hezbollah Zabadani Islamic State group airstrikes A double suicide bombing in northern Syria on Tuesday targeted the headquarters of an Islamist rebel group killing its leader and several other high ranking members. The attack was the second time in less than a year that a bombing takes out the leadership of Ahrar al-Sham (\"Free men of the Levant\") one of the most powerful Islamic groups fighting both President Bashar Assads forces and its rival the Islamic State group which holds wide swaths of territory in Syria and Iraq. Tuesdays attack struck the headquarters of Ahrar al-Sham northwest of the town of Idlib killing the groups leader Abu Abdelrahman Salqeen. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said six other Ahrar al-Sham members also died. The Local Coordination Committees and other activists also reported the attack. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing. \t \t The attack came a few days after a senior member of Ahrar al-Sham published an op-ed piece in the Washington Post in which he denied espousing al-Qaedas ideology and portrayed his group as the moderate Islamist alternative in Syria claiming it was a key to defeating the IS. In September Ahrar al-Shams leader Hassan Abboud was killed along with several other leading members of the group in a similar bombing also in Idlib province. Ahrar al-Sham is the largest group in the Jaysh al-Fateh (Army of Conquest) the coalition of Islamist and moderate rebel groups that took control of the regime-held stronghold of Idlib in March this year. According to a report in al-Monitor the various groups in Jaysh al-Fateh are having trouble agreeing on a unified approach to governing the territory they have captured. The other large group in the coalition the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front reportedly attacked Sharia court buildings and police stations affiliated with Ahrar al-Sham-dominated Sharia authority for managing the liberated areas in Idlib in Kafr Nabl on 8 July. \t \tSyrian forces backed by Lebanese Hezbollah fighters have entered a rebel-held mountain resort near the border with Lebanon. This follows protests in the Idlib countryside against the Nusra Front which Nusra fighters suppressed reportedly with the use of lethal force and a bomb at a mosque last Friday in which killed at least 10 members of the group according to Reuters. UN envoy meets southern rebels UN Special Envoy for the Syria Crisis Staffan de Mistura met with leaders of the Southern Front alliance in southern Syria on Tuesday for the first time according to Reuters. The Southern Front alliance controls a significant amount of territory between the capital Damascus and the southern border and has made a number of significant gains against regime forces over the last few months. De Mistura began an extensive round of meetings with parties directly or indirectly involved in the conflict in May with an eye to ending the brutal four-year civil war. According to his office he plans to finalise plans by the end of July to reach a political solution to the conflict. Regime offensive tightens grip on Zabadani State media says Syrian forces backed by Lebanese Hizbollah fighters have entered a rebel-held mountain resort near the border with Lebanon a day after launching a major offensive to capture the town. State-run Syrian TV said troops entered the town of Zabadani from the western Jamaiyat district Sunday. Hezbollahs al-Manar TV ran exclusive footage purportedly showing Hezbollah fighters in the town. It showed scenes of heavy fighting including explosions and mushrooms of white smoke. According to other sources the regimes latest attempt to secure Zabadani started 12 days ago. \t \tMeshaal killed in an airstrike in Hasakeh composed several Jihadi hymns for the IS celebrating martyrdom and holy war. Regime warplanes and helicopters launched at least 60 air raids yesterday on the rebel-held Syrian town of Zabadani to the west of Damascus and a short distance from the Lebanese border according to a monitoring group. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said there had been at least 29 raids by warplanes on Zabadani and at least 34 barrel bombs dropped by helicopters so far today. The raids come as forces from the regimes army and Hezbollah are engaged in their 11th day of heavy fighting with rebel forces in the area for control of the strategic town. A spokesperson for the Zabadani Revolution Coordination Committee told al-Araby al-Jadeed on Monday that forces from the regimes army and Hezbollah had made several attempts to advance into the town from the south but all of these attempts had been repelled. Zabadanis capture would tighten Hezbollahs grip on Syrian territories bordering Lebanon and strengthen the Syrian governments control over of the Beirut-Damascus highway. The town has been held by rebels since shortly after Syrias crisis began in March 2011. US airstrikes target the IS The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported the death of two senior Islamic State group (IS) leaders in a suspected US airstrike on Monday. Abu Osama al-Iraqi and Amer al-Rafdan were killed in what is believed to have been US airstrikes in Hasakeh. A Saudi national Maher Meshaal known as Abu Hajar al-Hadrami was also killed in airstrikes in Hasakeh according to IS supporters on twitter CBS reported. Meshaal composed several Jihadi hymns for the IS celebrating martyrdom and holy war. The airstrikes come a week after President Barrack Obama announced the US would intensify its campaign of airstrikes against the IS in northern Syria.\n",

      "Original article:  Last updated at Jul 012016 BEIRUT At least 70 regime and rebel fighters have been killed in 24 hours in a government assault and an extremist-led counterattack in northern Syria a monitor said Thursday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 30 regime soldiers and 39 rebel fighters had been killed in battles around Al Maleh north of Aleppo since Wednesday afternoon. Extremists fighting for Al Nusra Front the Syrian branch of Al Qaeda were also killed said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman who did not provide a precise number. The government of President Bashar Assad has been attempting to seize Al Maleh for more than two years. His forces have been trying for months to surround Aleppo by cutting supply lines between rebel-held districts of the city and nearby Turkey which supports opposition forces. For nearly a week regime troops backed by Syrian and Russian warplanes have been battling for control of Al Maleh. Assads regime is also attempting to cut the Castello Road a key supply route from the Turkish border to rebel-held eastern suburbs of Aleppo. The pro-regime website Al Masdar News reported that the Syrian army withdrew from the farms of Al Maleh as they faced a rebel counter-offensive led by Al Nusra Front. It said rebels attacked government forces with two suicide car bombs. The observatory said two children were killed by regime bombs in a rebel-held area of Aleppo. The majority of Aleppo province is controlled by Al Nusra and its Islamist allies while the city the countrys pre-war commercial capital has been divided since July 2012 into rebel-held and regime-held areas. Five civilians including three children were also killed by regime bombs that landed on eastern Ghouta the observatory reported on Thursday.\n",

      "Original article:  Suicide bomber kills six in Syria restaurant Reports Suicide bombing in Aleppo restaurant at student graduation celebration kills six and wounds 19 some in critical condition says monitoring group AFP Friday 23 Aug 2013 A suicide bombing in a restaurant in Syrias second city Aleppo killed six people including a journalist from pro-government television state media and a monitoring group said Friday. The blast struck as a group of youths celebrated the graduation of a student who was one of those killed in the attack in the dining area of Mogambo on Thursday said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. \"The attack also wounded 19 people including some in critical condition\" said the Britain-based organisation. The official SANA news agency also reported the attack and singled out the death of the journalist it identified as Al-Ikhbariya TV correspondent Hassan Muhanna. The attack occurred in a part of Aleppo controlled by the regime of President Bashar al-Assad which has been fighting an armed uprising for more than two years in a conflict that has killed more than 100000. On May 27 another Al-Ikhbariya journalist was killed by a sniper in the then rebel stronghold of Qusayr. Prior to his death media watchdog Reporters Without Borders said 23 journalists had been killed in Syria since the countrys conflict erupted in March 2011.\n",

      "Original article:  Published September 21 2016 Five medics were killed and a nurse critically wounded when an air strike hit a clinic in a village near Syrias second city Aleppo late Tuesday the aid group that supports it said. The four staff of the Union of Syrian Medical Relief Organisations (UOSSM) were in two ambulances that had been called to the clinic to take some patients for more specialised treatment the group said. The clinic in the village of Khan Tuman was completely levelled in the 1100 pm (2000 GMT) strike and more dead were feared to be buried under the rubble the group added. \"The building has three floors including a basement. Because of the intensity of the bombardment the three storeys collapsed and are completely destroyed\" the groups hospitals and trauma director for the area Ahmed Dbais said in a statement. \"We dont yet know exactly how many dead there are.\" The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said that nine members of the Army of Conquest rebel alliance who were working in the clinic were also killed. The alliance groups rebels with former Al-Qaeda affiliate the Fateh al-Sham Front and Moscow has repeatedly demanded that it be disbanded to allow intensified air strikes against the terrorist faction. Khan Tuman is near Orum al-Kubrah the town where an attack on aid trucks and a warehouse killed around 20 civilians on Monday triggering a war of words between major powers after Washington accused Moscow of responsibility. According to the World Heath Organization Syria is the most dangerous country in the world for health professionals with 135 strikes on clinics and hospitals last year. The head of UOSSM France Dr Ziad Alissa condemned the \"unacceptable\" attack on the groups clinic and staff. \"Deliberately targeting humanitarian workers and medical professionals is a clear violation of international humanitarian law\" he said. \"We appeal to the international community to act swiftly to put a stop to these atrocities. Too many lives have been lost.\" The UOSSM is a medical aid group originally founded by Syrian expatriates but now international.\n",

Tags Syria Islamic State Group Three children were among at least 19 civilian killed in an air raid on a village held by the Islamic State group in northern Syria on Wednesday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it was unclear who had carried out the strike which took place in an area where rebels backed by Turkish forces are advancing against IS.

Thalthana lies near the key IS stronghold of Al-Bab and is just 12km southeast of IS-held Dabiq which Turkish-backed rebels have been pushing towards in recent days.

His forces have been trying for months to surround Aleppo by cutting supply lines between rebel-held districts of the city and nearby Turkey which supports opposition forces. For nearly a week regime troops backed by Syrian and Russian warplanes have been battling for control of Al-Maleh. Assads regime is also attempting to cut the Castello Road a key supply route from the Turkish border to rebel-held eastern suburbs of Aleppo. The pro-regime website Al-Masdar News reported that the Syrian army withdrew from the farms of Al-Maleh as they faced a rebel counter-offensive led by the Al-Nusra Front. It said rebels attacked government forces with two suicide car bombs. The Observatory said two children were killed by regime bombs in a rebel-held area of Aleppo. The majority of Aleppo province is controlled by Al-Nusra and its Islamist allies while the city the countrys pre-war commercial capital has been divided since July 2012 into rebel-held and regime-held areas. Thirteen civilians including four children were also killed in regime missile attacks on Eastern Ghouta in the Damascus region the Observatory reported Thursday updating an earlier toll. The conflict in Syria which has lasted five years has killed more than 280000 people.\n",

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 30 regime soldiers and 39 rebel fighters had been killed in battles around Al-Maleh north of Aleppo since Wednesday afternoon. Jihadists fighting for the Al-Nusra Front, the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda were also killed said Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman who did not provide a precise number. The government of President Bashar al-Assad has been attempting to seize Al-Maleh for more than two years. His forces have been trying for months to surround Aleppo by cutting supply lines between rebel-held districts of the city and nearby Turkey which supports opposition forces. For nearly a week regime troops backed by Syrian and Russian warplanes have been battling for control of Al-Maleh. Assad's regime is also attempting to cut the Castello Road, a key supply route from the Turkish border to rebel-held eastern suburbs of Aleppo. The pro-regime website Al-Masdar News reported that the Syrian army withdrew from the farms of Al-Maleh as they faced a rebel counter-offensive led by the Al-Nusra Front. It said rebels attacked government forces with two suicide car bombs. The Observatory said two children were killed by regime bombs in a rebel-held area of Aleppo. Thirteen civilians, including four children, were also killed in shelling by regime forces on Idlib. The conflict in Syria, which has lasted five years, has killed more than 280000 people.\n",

      "Original article:  10 October 2017 Russian Defense Ministry: More than 100 ISIS terrorists killed in Deir Ezzor. Russian Defense Ministry said that US-led coalition has sharply reduced the intensity of its attacks on ISIS terrorists positions in Iraq following the beginning of military operations of the Syrian Arab Army to liberate Deir Ezzor. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said on Tuesday that The continuing supply of terrorists from Iraq raises serious questions about the objectives of operations against terrorists conducted in the region by aircraft of the United States and the so-called international coalition adding that in the western part of Iraq ISIS-controlled territory continues to increase. Konashenkov affirmed that the actions of the coalition require clarification. Does such a shift in the US and the coalitions priorities mean the desire to complicate the operation conducted by the Syrian army supported by Russias Aerospace Forces to liberate Syrias territory east of the Euphrates? Or is it a possibility to liberate Iraq from ISIS terrorists driving them into Syria under the precise airstrikes of the Russian Aerospace Forces? he questioned. Russias Aerospace Forces carry out up to 150 strikes per day on ISIS terrorists positions near al- Mayadin city in Deir Ezzor supporting the expand military operation of the Syrian army to liberate the city the largest ISIS positions in Deir Ezzor. Konashenkov said that over the past 24 hours Russias aerospace group dealt 182 strikes against the positions of ISIS terrorists who had infiltrated to Deir Ezzor province from Iraq. Two pairs of Sukhoi-34 bombers were commissioned to hit the targets. Fourteen consecutive strikes were made Konashenkov added. Objective monitoring means confirmed the destruction of four tanks three armored personnel carriers and nine off-road vehicles armed with heavy machineguns and two multiple rocket launchers. Fifty terrorists were killed and another 30 sealed off in the underground tunnels Konashenkov said. Forty minutes later a Sukhoi-34 bomber carried out another attack against this stronghold to kill another 20 terrorists who had arrived for evacuating those injured he added. The Russian Aerospace Forces have destroyed the economic infrastructure of ISIS in Syria and foiled any attempts by terrorists to resume the production and illegal sale of hydrocarbons in Syria. ISIS no longer has the sources of financing for purchasing weapons and ammunition and recruiting mercenaries in Syria he said. Konashenkov added a command center of ISIS and three groups of terrorists who had arrived from Iraq had been destroyed near Hatla town. The elimination of 34 terrorists five off-road vehicles carrying large caliber weapons and two trucks full of ammunition has been confirmed he said. Shaza/Mazen\n",

      "Original article:  Workers dig out dead after Syria regime strike on Aleppo AFP Tuesday 30 Sep 2014 At least eight people were killed on Tuesday among them four children when Syrian regime helicopters dropped explosives-packed barrel bombs on a district of northern Aleppo a monitoring group said. The attack between the neighbourhoods of Sakhur and Sheikh Khodr caused widespread damage levelling several buildings and shearing the facades off others. Civil defence members in the rebel-held east of the city rushed to the scene using bulldozers and pickaxes to clear rubble and twisted metal. Some local residents also pitched in to help as others could only looked on dazed at the destruction. The emergency crews partly unearthed one body which appeared to be that of a teenager clad in pink trousers visible under thick dust. Not far away they worked to remove rubble from around another body a small arm that appeared to be that of a child emerging from the shattered brickwork. \"The strike here was this morning. Can you show me even one person here from the Free Syrian Army (rebel fighters)?\" asked Jihad who survived the bombing. \"The people here were all women and children who were sleeping\" he said. Shuhud al-Hussein a member of the civil defence forces said his team had rushed to the scene after hearing the sound of the barrel bomb explosion. \"A helicopter dropped two barrels\" he said. \"This area doesnt have any military groups in it at all its just residents women and children\" Hussein said. \"Were trying to help the people here we were able to pull two children out alive thank God\" he added.\n",
