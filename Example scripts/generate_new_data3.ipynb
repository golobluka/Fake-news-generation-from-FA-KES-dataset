(AFP Photo) At least 16 civilians including women and children were killed Friday during an air raid by the Syrian regime army on the opposition-held neighborhood of Tareeq al-Bab in Aleppo Syrias largest city according to a pro-opposition civil defense source on the ground. The missiles fired from a Syrian warplane also wounded 25 others Ibrahim Abu Leys told Anadolu Agency. Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the Bashar al-Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests - which erupted as part of the \"Arab Spring\" uprisings - with unexpected ferocity and disproportionate force. Since then more than a quarter of a million people have been killed - and more than 10 million displaced - throughout the war-battered country according to the UN. The Syrian Center for Policy Research an NGO however has put the death toll from the five-year conflict at as high as 470000.\n",

      "Original article:  31 Oct 2017 At least seven Syrian children were killed in regime shelling of a rebel-held area outside Damascus on Tuesday most as they left school activists said. The Syrian regime has intensified its campaign against the last rebel holdouts on the outskirts of the capital as Russian-sponsored talks in Kazakhstan aim to consolidate de-escalation zones in different parts of the country. The limited local truces are aimed at freezing the lines of the six-year-old civil war which has claimed an estimated 400000 lives and allowing humanitarian aid to flow into besieged areas. The Ghouta Media Center and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least five children were killed when a shell landed at the gate of a school in Jisreen a town in the eastern Ghouta suburbs of Damascus as children were leaving for the day. The Observatory said the death toll is likely to rise and that another child was killed in the village from another shell. One of the children had his legs blown off. Shelling in the northeastern town of Musraba has meanwhile killed another three people including a child according to the Observatory. The Ghouta Media Center said four were killed including two children. Another shell in Harasta also in the eastern Ghouta suburbs landed near a school but only caused injuries. Eastern Ghouta which is still home to an estimated 350000 people has endured years of siege and shelling which has continued despite a de-escalation agreement backed by the regime and its close allies Russia and Iran. On Monday the United Nations said it reached thousands of residents for the first time in over a month. The area is one of the last remaining pockets of opposition to regime leader Assad and depends on aid and smuggling. Rebels have responded to the shelling with a barrage of mortars lobbed at regime-held districts in Damascus wounding at least 10 civilians in three neighbourhoods. The rebels and the regime are meanwhile set to conclude the latest round of talks in the Kazakh capital Astana. The negotiations are sponsored by Turkey which backs the rebels as well as Russia and Iran. The de-escalation zones agreed to in Astana have significantly reduced the violence in many parts of Syria but a lasting political solution remains elusive.

      "Original article:  Wednesday 21 August 2013 Syrian opposition: 1300 killed in chemical attack on Ghouta region. At least 1300 people have been killed in a nerve gas attack on Syrias Ghouta region leading opposition figure George Sabra said on Wednesday. In response the opposition Syrian National Coalition called for an urgent U.N. Security Council meeting on the subject. I call on the Security Council to convene urgently National Coalition leader Ahmed al-Jarba added to Al-Arabiya news channel condemning the Syrian armys bombardment of the Ghouta suburbs of Damascus as a massacre. Meanwhile The Arab League called Wednesday on U.N. chemical weapons inspectors now inside Syria to immediately visit the site of the incident. Arab League chief Nabil al-Arabi urged the inspectors in a statement to go immediately to Eastern Ghouta to see the reality of the situation and investigate the circumstances of this crime. Britain said on Wednesday it would raise a reported chemical weapons attack by forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad at the United Nations Security Council and called on Damascus to give U.N. inspectors access to the site Reuters reported. I am deeply concerned by reports that hundreds of people including children have been killed in airstrikes and a chemical weapons attack on rebel-held areas near Damascus British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement. France also called for action by the U.N. during a cabinet session Hollande announced his intention to ask the U.N. to visit the site of the attack government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem told reporters on Wednesday. This information obviously requires verification and confirmation she added. Activists at the Syrian Revolutionary Command Council said regime fighter planes were flying over the area after the bombardment accusing the forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad of using chemical agents. The attack was on rebel-held areas of eastern Damascus. Regime forces ... stepped up military operations in the Eastern Ghouta and Western Ghouta zones of the Damascus region with aircraft and rocket launchers causing several dozen dead and wounded the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told AFP news agency. The intensive bombing on the outskirts of the capital could be heard by residents of Damascus where a grey cloud capped the sky. The Britain-based Observatory which relies on a vast network of activists on the ground and medics said the army operation was aimed at the recapture of Madhamiyat el-Sham an area southwest of Damascus. The Local Coordination Committees (LCC) a network of activists reported hundreds of casualties in the brutal use of toxic gas by the criminal regime in parts of Western Ghouta. According to Reuters news agency the reported use of the chemical agents could not be immediately verified. The news coincides with a visit to Damascus by a United Nations team of chemical weapons experts. In an interview with Al Arabiya Syrian National Coalition chief Ahmad Jarba called on the U.N. investigators to travel to Ghouta the site of the massacre. Activists from the grassroots Local Coordination Committee reported at least 30 bodies had been brought to one field hospital in Kafr Batna neighborhood a few miles east of central Damascus according to Reuters. Meanwhile the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said dozens of people were killed including children in fierce bombardment. Activists at the Local Coordinating Committees said Mouadamiya southwest of the capital came under the heaviest attack since the start of the two-year conflict. Regime denial Meanwhile Syrian authorities denied charges that the army used chemical weapons in the attacks. Reports on the use of chemical weapons in (the suburbs of) Ghouta are totally false state news agency SANA said. It dismissed as unfounded the reports from opposition activists and said satellite news channels carrying the reports are implicated in the shedding of Syrian blood and support terrorism. Its an attempt to prevent the U.N. commission of inquiry from carrying out its mission the statement added. (With Reuters and AFP) \n",

      "Original article:  Posted on August 3 2013 by Nazeer Rida At least 12 Islamist fighters were killed in clashes with Kurdish militants in the Syrian city of Hasaka early Friday the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said. Clashes erupted on Friday at midnight between fighters from the Peoples Protection Units (YPG) on the one hand and fighters from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and the Al-Nusra Front on the other hand the SOHR announced. Fridas fighting came after renewed tensions between the two sides in Kurdish-dominated areas to the north and east of Syria. This is not the first time that Islamists linked to Al-Qaeda and Kurdish militants have fought since the Syrian crisis erupted in 2011. Rebel-on-rebel violence has been frequent in areas along the Turkish border and last month witnessed heavy clashes in the oil-rich city of Ras Al-Ayn in northeastern Syria. The ArabKurdish crisis appears to include the Free Syrian Army (FSA). A video posted on the internet showed Col. Abdul Jabbar Akidi a member of the FSA military council announcing that the FSA has sent reinforcement to Islamists. This cannot be tolerated. If it is necessary we will wipe out the PKK he said referring to the Kurdistan Workers Party. Viewed as the largest Kurdish political and military formation in Syria the Democratic Union Party (PYD) dismissed Akidis statement as unjustified. Speaking exclusively to Asharq Al-Awsat PYD spokesman Nawaf Khalil said that reasons for Akidis calls to fight Kurds are unknown and that the PKK has clearly announced that the Syrian regime and its supporters have lost legitimacy. This attack is meant to be against the entire Kurdish region on the pretext of fighting the PKK Khalil said stressing that Kurds will fight those who attack them. The PYD the Syrian franchise of the Turkish PKK is believed to stand as the largest political and military formation in Syria and has assumed control over the Kurdish-dominated areas to the east and north of Syria since July 2012 setting up checkpoints and running public affairs. Khalil reaffirmed to Asharq Al-Awsat the PYDs despire to topple the regime as well as its opposition to the Al-Qaeda-linked rebel groups such as the Al-Nusra Front. We did not want to go into battles with the Islamists particularly after the agreement we signed with them but today they are laying siege to us in addition to the siege laid by the Syrian regime on the one hand and Turkey along the borders on the other the PYD spokesman said. He added The stances of the opposition and the FSA serve the interests of the dictatorial regime. They should have looked for a formula to deal cooperate and even coordinate on the ground with the Kurdish side in the face of the regimes aggression. We work to topple the regime and coordinate with all sides but we will not accept the Islamists the regime army or the FSA entering our area. In other news the UN said it would probe reports opposition fighters committed a massacre against troops loyal to Assad in Khan Al-Assal after seizing the strategic town from the regime last week UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said in a statement. After examining videos documenting the atrocities committed by rebels Pillay said These images if verified suggest that executions were committed in Khan Al-Assal calling for a thorough independent investigation to establish whether war crimes have been committed. She also warned that all sides in Syria should not think they are immune from prosecution. Nazeer Rida\n",

Nearly 75 terrorist killed including 30 foreign-sponsored Takfiri terrorists and nore than 100 wounded in offensive they had unsuccessfully launched to reopen a key supply route into the Syrian northern city of Aleppo. The London Based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced on Sunday that militants from the Nusra Front (Syrian branch of al-Qaeda) and its allied terrorists of Faylaq al-Sham mounted an attack to recapture the strategic Castello Road on Thursday. It added that Syrian army soldiers launched a counter-offensive killing 29 extremists and foiling their attack. The attack has ended and the road remains completely closed said Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman. The Castello Road was effectively severed by Syrian forces Thursday when they seized a hilltop within firing range of the key supply route. By Saturday the army soldiers were within 500 meters of the road and firing on any vehicle attempting to use it. The capture of the Castello Road came in the wake of recent recapture of al-Mallah Farms area northwest of Aleppo by the Syrian army in the. The capture of Mallah Farms and Castello Road enabled Syrian forces to besiege militant-held neighborhoods of Aleppo and puts them within the firing range of the army. 12\n",

      "Original article:  Date of publication 7 July 2016 Video More than 33 people were killed in Syrian regime and Russian bombing on Wednesday despite Damascus promises of a truce to mark the Muslim Eid holidays. Syrian regime Manbij human rights truce Eid Syrian opposition territories were bombed on Wednesday hours after the Syrian regime announced a nationwide ceasefire for three days. Rebel-held areas in Aleppo and Idlib provinces were bombed despite Damascus promise of a 72-hours Eid al-Fitr truce. Three children were killed in five separate air raids on Jisr al-Shigour in Idlib province while a car bomb exploded outside a mosque in the city according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Other air raids took place in Aleppo while clashes between rebels and regime fighters continued across the day. A total of 33 people died according to the Local Coordination Committees with Russian and regime war planes both suspected. Regime advances cut the only road leading to rebel-held parts of Aleppo in the firing range cutting it off on Thursday. \"Currently nobody can get in or out of Aleppo\" a member of the Aleppo-based rebel group Fastaqim told Reuters. \"[The road] was not risk-free but now there is not a matter of danger now the road is cut\" Zakaria Malahjifi said. Rebel forces are battling to push back regime advances. [Click to enlarge] \"All the factions sent reinforcements and are trying to take back the positions taken by the government but the situation is very bad there was heavy government air cover in the night\" another rebel official told Reuters. It is estimated that between 250000 and 300000 people live in areas held by the opposition in Aleppo according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. In Ghouta a rebel-held area in the Damascus suburbs regime artillery hit Douma city while clashes continued between rebel and regime fighters in Daraa Latakia and Homs. Meanwhile US-led coalition warplanes killed 56 civilians including 19 children in Manbij in Aleppo province according to the Observatory. Assault on Manbij Kurdish-led forces are continuing their assault on the Islamic State group stronghold in northern Syria and are slowly advancing in the southern districts of Manbij and seized a number of silos on Wednesday. Coalition aircraft which are supporting the Kurdish-Arab forces on the ground have conducted 325 air raids around Manbij since 21 May including 29 strikes in the past four days. This has helped anti-IS fighters to gain 1000 kilometres of territory and a foothold in Manbij which is an important supply route for the jihadi force. \"The SDF [Syrian Democratic Forces] has repeatedly defeated [IS] attempts to punch a hole through the cordon\" said Operation Inherent Resolve spokesperson Colonel Christopher Garver on Wednesday. He said this pressure is forcing IS to bring in new recruits to defend the city from the Kurdish-Arab force. \"Weve seen [IS] fighters leaving these previously defended towns to attempt to reinforce Manbij\" Garver said. \"As the pressure increases against [IS] in Manbij they are demonstrating more desperation to keep [IS] strategic crossroads open for access outside Syria.\" Read Also\n",

Other workers from the rescue team were also injured in the attack the group said with four children and one man killed in earlier regime shelling. \"The civil defence [White Helmets] condemns the bombing and raids on the cities and towns of eastern Ghouta which focuses on targeting civilian centres and aid workers\" the group said in a statement. \"Today the regime air force targeted [a] Syrian civil defence team [as they were] working in Douma city. Three volunteers were killed and most of the other volunteers were injured.\" Siege Watch claimed the workers were targeted by a \"guided missile\" which follows routine \"double tap\" attacks on bomb sites as rescue workers attempt to save survivors. Opposition Damascus suburb Eastern Ghouta has been subject to ferocious bombing and shelling by the Syrian regime this week. At least six children were among 12 civilians killed in the district during bombing and shelling on Friday Siege Watch reported. The White Helmets said that 45 people have been killed and 307 injured in three days of regime attacks on Eastern Ghouta. These include the use of 38 banned cluster bombs drone attacks hundreds of shells and five surface-to-surface missiles. Eastern Ghouta is also subject to a horrific siege which is starving the civilian population and leaving them without desperately needed medical equipment and medicine activists and NGOs say. White Helmets volunteers are the first on the scene at sites hit by bombs and shells with scores killed in subsequent attacks. The group are believed to have saved the lives of more than 100000 Syrians injured in bombings. Read Also\n",

      "Original article:  16 dead in heavy bombardment on Syrias Idlib Monitor AFP Monday 24 Oct 2016 Sixteen civilians including three children were killed on Monday in heavy bombardment across rebel-held Idlib province in northwest Syria a monitoring group said. In Khan Sheikhun a town in the provinces south air strikes killed seven people including two women and a child the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based Observatory said the raids were carried out by either Syrian or Russian aircraft. Another seven people including four women and two children were killed in raids on Kafr Takharim further north in the province. Those raids hit three residential buildings a local government building and a stadium shortly after midnight AFPs correspondent in the town said. In the morning rescue workers were still trying to pull bodies out of the rubble. \"My sisters house was standing right here. She and her daughter are dead along with another family\" Abu Mohammad told AFP. \"There was no military base here. All the military positions are outside the town\" the devastated man said. Another man and a woman were killed in rocket fire in the nearby town of Kafr Awid. Idlib province is controlled by the Army of Conquest an alliance of rebel groups and jihadists including the Fateh al-Sham Front which changed its name from Al-Nusra Front after breaking off ties with Al-Qaeda. According to the Observatory heavy bombardment has battered the northwest province in recent days. Since Thursday bombardment has killed 44 civilians including 11 women nine children and one rescue worker. Syrias conflict broke out in March 2011 with anti-government protests but it has since evolved into all-out war pitting rebels government forces Kurds and jihadists against each other.\n",

At least 30 militants of the terrorist group operating in Iraq and Syria were killed in clashes with Kurdish troops in northeastern Syria on Thursday reports said. At least 30 militants of the terrorist group operating in Iraq and Syria were killed in clashes with Kurdish troops in northeastern Syria on Thursday reports said. The fighting pitted ISIL militants against members of the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units (YPG) in the village of Qassiab in Hasakeh province according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The YPG regained control of the village two days after it was seized by the terrorists said the Britain-based group. The Kurds also lost three fighters in the clashes it added. ISIL launched last June a brutal offensive against several areas across Iraq and Syria as it announced its so-called caliphate in these areas. However several forces including the Iraqi army backed by the Kurdish fighters and popular forces and the Syria army have been since June waging counter attack in order to regain areas seized by the Takfiri terrorists.\n",

      "Original article:  Rebel fire kills 3 Aleppo schoolchildren state media AFP Thursday 27 Oct 2016 At least three children were killed and 14 injured in a rebel rocket attack on a school in the government-held west of Aleppo city on Thursday Syrian state media said. A monitoring group said a child was also among at least eight people killed in government shelling on the rebel-held town of Douma outside Damascus. \"Three children were killed and 14 students were injured in a terrorist rocket attack on the national school in the Shahba neighbourhood of Aleppo\" state news agency SANA reported. The neighbourhood is in the western outskirts of the city which has been roughly divided since mid-2012 when rebels seized its eastern half. Rebels regularly fire crude homemade rockets into the west of the city often killing civilians. Government forces backed by ally Russia have waged an aerial and ground assault since late September to recapture eastern Aleppo killing hundreds of civilians and destroying infrastructure including hospitals. The deaths came a day after the UN childrens agency UNICEF said 22 children had been killed along with six teachers in air strikes on a school in rebel-held Idlib province. The strikes carried out by either Russian or Syrian warplanes according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights hit the village of Hass prompting outrage from UNICEF director Anthony Lake. \"This is a tragedy. It is an outrage. And if deliberate it is a war crime\" he said adding that the school complex had been hit repeatedly. Outside Damascus meanwhile at least eight people were killed on Thursday in government shelling on Douma in the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta region the British-based Observatory said. Douma is regularly targeted by government fire and in recent months regime forces have waged an offensive in the area which has also been under siege since 2013. More than 300000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests.\n",

      "Original article:  11 Aug 2016 According to the Al-Quds hospital four people died while over 50 were injured in the attack. A man breathes through an oxygen mask at Al-Quds hospital. A hospital and a civil defence group said a gas what they believed to be chlorine was dropped alongside barrel bombs on a neighbourhood of Aleppo. (TRT World and Agencies) At least four people died and many suffered breathing difficulties when gas believed to be chlorine was dropped alongside barrel bombs on a neighbourhood of the Syrian city of Aleppo on Wednesday a hospital and a civil defence group said. Hamza Khatib the manager of Al-Quds hospital in Aleppo told a Reuters photographer the hospital had recorded four deaths from gas poisoning and 55 injuries. Seven people were still receiving hospital treatment. Khatib said he was preserving pieces of patients clothing and fragments from the barrel bombs as evidence for analysis. Syria Civil Defence a Syrian rescue service operating in rebel-held territory said it had recorded three deaths and 22 injuries after a barrel containing a gas suspected of being chlorine fell on the Zubdiya neighbourhood of rebel-held Aleppo. Civilians brought to the Al-Quds hospital after the suspected gas attack. (Reuters) The group which describes itself as a neutral band of search and rescue volunteers said it could not independently verify the nature of the gas. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a war monitor said helicopters dropped explosive barrels on the neighbourhoods of Seif al Dawla and Zubdiya leading to the death of a woman and her child from suffocation. The northern city of Aleppo Syrias most populous before the war is split into rebel- and regime-held districts. Capturing the whole city would be a major prize for Syrias Bashar al-Assad in the countrys five-year-old conflict. A fierce battle for control of the city broke out on Friday when rebels staged a major assault to break through a month-long regime siege of the citys rebel-held east where about 300000 people are thought to be living. Fighters managed to pierce the ring of regime-controlled territory but a safe corridor for civilians and aid has not yet been established. There have been unconfirmed reports among activists and residents of chlorine gas falling on rebel-held east Aleppo since the rebel offensive. The Aleppo Media Centre an online opposition news portal for the city posted a video that it said was of victims of the gas attack a child and adults wearing breathing apparatus. Two men interviewed said barrel bombs were dropped and there was a strong smell of gas. People then began to suffer breathing and eye problems. A boy breathes through an oxygen mask at Al-Quds hospital after the suspected gas attack. (Reuters) Western powers say the Syrian regime has been responsible for chlorine and other chemical attacks. The government has accused rebels of using poison gas. UN investigators established that sarin gas was used in Eastern Ghouta in 2013. The United States accused Damascus of that attack which it estimates killed 1429 people including at least 426 children. Damascus denied responsibility and blamed rebels. Later that year the United Nations and the Syrian regime agreed to destroy the states declared stockpile of chemical weapons a process completed in January 2016. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons confirmed in late 2015 that sulphur mustard commonly known as mustard gas had been used for the first time in the conflict without saying which party in the many-sided conflict it thought had used it.

      "Original article:  Wednesday 30 November 2016 Coalition Letter to UN & UNSC Presses for Stopping Assads & Russias Onslaught on Aleppo. The Syrian Coalition called upon the United Nations as the main international sponsor of the political process in Syria to take immediate and decisive action to ensure the protection of the civilians in Aleppo. Action must be taken to stop the barbaric attack on the civilians in Aleppo by compelling the Assad regime to abide by the terms of a cessation of hostilities; allowing unfettered and immediate humanitarian access and medical aid to the city; holding into account those responsible for these crimes; and preventing the repetition of such gross violations.In a letter sent by President of the Syrian Coalition Anas Abdah to the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and President of the UN Security Council Fode Seck the Coalition underscored the desperate humanitarian situation in Aleppo as the regime and its allies continue their relentless indiscriminate bombardment of Aleppo and its countryside.Every hospital in Aleppo has gone out of service leaving hundreds of people injured by the indiscriminate bombardment at the risk of losing their lives for complete lack of medical care the letter said.Abdah noted that the Assad regime and his allies are turning the liberated areas of the city of Aleppo into a real coffin given that official food stocks run out and civilians are under siege.This outrageous escalation in Aleppo has killed more than 670 40% of them are children caused the displacement of more than 3000 families destroyed 11 hospitals and medical centers and known the use of the chlorine gas four times which constitutes a further crime against humanity and a war crime in the regimes long bloody record of barbarity.The letter added: On the other hand it runs in the face of all the international relations including UNSCR 2118 (2013) and 2235 (2015) concerned with the use of indiscriminate weapons in Syria and UNSCR 2254 (2015) and 2268 (2016) endorsing the cessation of hostilities and humanitarian access agreement.The letter also stressed that the Assad regime can only persist in this criminality as long as it enjoys the impunity it has enjoyed so far by the international inaction let alone the active support of its allies particularly Russia.As a pioneer of the human rights and the international peace and security in the world the United Nations has the responsibility to translate words into action to protect the civilians in Aleppo and to make sure that the regimes criminality against its own people no longer goes without consequences.

      "Original article:  At least 70 killed in north of Syrias Aleppo Monitor AFP Thursday 30 Jun 2016 At least 70 regime and rebel fighters have been killed in 24 hours in a government assault and a jihadist-led counterattack in northern Syria a monitor said Thursday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 30 regime soldiers and 39 rebel fighters had been killed in battles around Al-Maleh north of Aleppo since Wednesday afternoon. Jihadists fighting for the Al-Nusra Front the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda were also killed said Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman who did not provide a precise number. The government of President Bashar al-Assad has been attempting to seize Al-Maleh for more than two years. His forces have been trying for months to surround Aleppo by cutting supply lines between rebel-held districts of the city and nearby Turkey which supports opposition forces. For nearly a week regime troops backed by Syrian and Russian warplanes have been battling for control of Al-Maleh. Assads regime is also attempting to cut the Castello Road a key supply route from the Turkish border to rebel-held eastern suburbs of Aleppo. The pro-regime website Al-Masdar News reported that the Syrian army withdrew from the farms of Al-Maleh as they faced a rebel counter-offensive led by the Al-Nusra Front. It said rebels attacked government forces with two suicide car bombs. The Observatory said two children were killed by regime bombs in a rebel-held area of Aleppo. The majority of Aleppo province is controlled by Al-Nusra and its Islamist allies while the city the countrys pre-war commercial capital has been divided since July 2012 into rebel-held and regime-held areas. Thirteen civilians including four children were also killed in regime missile attacks on Eastern Ghouta in the Damascus region the Observatory reported Thursday updating an earlier toll. The conflict in Syria which has lasted five years has killed more than 280000 people.\n",

      "Original article:  Published July 4 2015 An explosion at a mosque in Syrias Idlib province on Friday killed at least 25 members of the Al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said. The blast in the town of Ariha in northwestern Syria went off as members of the Nusra Front gathered at the mosque for iftar the meal with which Muslims break their fast during the holy month of Ramadan. Observatory which tracks the war said the explosion in Salem Mosque in Ariha also killed a senior non-Syrian member of the Nusra Front. Opposition-based social media websites had conflicting casualty figures with some saying more than 40 people were dead. Turkeys state-run Ananolu Agency reported 15 deaths citing a statement from Istanbul-based Syrian Revolution General Commission. No group announced responsibility for the blast but supporters of Nusra Front blamed rival self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (ISIS) militants who have fought the group on several frontlines in Syria. A coalition of rebel groups called Jaish al Fateh or Conquest Army in which Nusra Front is a major part of its composition have controlled most of Idlib province since the capture of the provincial capital in March. The region borders Turkey and neighbors President Bashar al-Assads heartland in Latakia province on the Mediterranean coast.\n",

      "Original article:  Tuesday 04 April 2017 Syrian Coalition Calls for Holding Assad Regime Accountable for Repeated Chemical Attacks. The Syrian Coalition called on the UN Security Council to hold the Assad regime accountable for the horrific crime his forces committed in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the rural Idlib at dawn today. Chemical substances were used in the attack which left at least 100 people killed and over 400 wounded mostly women and children according to the directorate of health in Idlib province. In a press release issued on Tuesday the Coalition said that early photos and videos of the aftermath of the attack clearly show a horrible crime similar to the one the Assad regime committed in eastern Ghouta near Damascus in the summer of 2013 which the international community allowed to go unpunished. The Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to hold an emergency session to address this crime and conduct an immediate investigation into it. Urgent measures need to be taken to ensure that those who ordered executed supported and are involved in the attack are held accountable under Chapter VII of the UN Charter the Coalition said. The failure to take concrete urgent action would be understood by the Assad regime as a blessing for its actions. Inaction is no more an option as it amounts to direct involvement and even direct responsibility for those crimes the Coalition added. The Assad regimes air force also carried out a massacre against civilians in the town of Douma in eastern Ghouta on Monday claiming the lives of at least 32 people including women and children. The Assad regime continues to use internationally prohibited weapons in bombing civilian areas in a blatant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and UN Security Council resolutions 2118 2209 2235 and 2254. These crimes would not have happened again had it not been for the lukewarm response by the international community and its failure to ensure protection for civilians the Coalition said. The Coalition called for the implementation of Article 21 of UN Security Council resolution 2118 which says the Council would take measures under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter in case of noncompliance including the transfer and use of chemical weapons.

(TRT World and Agencies) Syrian regime or Russian air strikes in and around a town in opposition-held Idlib province on Tuesday killed 26 people and severely damaged a hospital a monitoring group said. The attacks came as Syrian regime forces and Russian jets intensified their bombardment of Idlib the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. A spokesman at the hospital in Kafr Takharim in Idlib said an air strike hit its courtyard killing 14 people including patients. Separate air strikes southwest of Kafr Takharim killed at least 12 people including civilians and rebel fighters the Observatory said. The United Nations condemned the air strikes and called for an end to such attacks on hospitals. \"It is completely unacceptable that facilities and people who are trying to save lives are being bombed\" said Kevin Kennedy Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Syria Crisis. \"It must stop\" he added. The Observatory said there were no deaths from the hospital strike but that the bombardment had put it out of action. Idlib is an opposition stronghold one of the few large areas still under rebel control in the west of the country. Rebels and their families who have chosen to leave areas under regime siege around Damascus in evacuation deals have headed for Idlib. Source TRTWorld and agencies\n",

      "Original article:  Tuesday 19 Jul 2016 US-led strikes kill 56 civilians in Syria Monitor AFP Children were among at least 56 civilians killed in strikes by a US-led coalition early on Tuesday near a Syrian village held by the Islamic State (IS) group a monitor said. \"There are at least 56 dead including 11 children and dozens more wounded including some in critical condition\" said Rami Abdel Rahman director of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The monitor said that the civilians were hit as they were fleeing fighting in the Aleppo province village of Al-Tukhar and that they had apparently been mistaken for IS group fighters. The Observatory - which relies on a network of sources inside Syria for its information - says it determines what planes carried out raids according to their type location flight patterns and the munitions involved. Asked about the incident the coalition had no immediate comment but said it was looking into the reports. Al-Tukhar lies 14 kilometres (nine miles) north of the town of Manbij a key IS group stronghold that has been repeatedly targeted in raids by the US-led coalition. On Monday the Observatory said 21 civilians had been killed in coalition raids in the area 15 in a northern district of Manbij and another six in Al-Tukhar. Manbij sits on ISs main supply route between Syria and neighbouring Turkey and has been the target of a US-backed offensive by a Kurdish-Arab alliance of fighters since May 31. In June the Syrian Democratic Forces alliance broke into western districts of the town but their advance has been slowed in the past month because of landmines planted by the jihadists and ongoing suicide attacks. Near Aleppo government forces sought to tighten their siege of rebel-held districts of the battleground second city. Clashes erupted around Handarat a largely deserted Palestinian refugee camp north of the city after government forces seized parts of the only remaining supply route into rebel-held eastern districts effectively severing them from the outside world. The capture of the Castello Road has raised fears of a lengthy siege of east Aleppo where residents have already reported food shortages and rising prices. The Observatory said fierce clashes were underway around Handarat Camp which is less than two kilometres (barely a mile) from the northern outskirts of the city. \"If the regime takes Handarat it will be able to completely asphyxiate the rebels in east Aleppo and they will be unable to launch counter-attacks to retake the Castello Road\" Abdel Rahman told AFP. Analysts have warned that the government advances around Aleppo could be \"devastating\" for the rebels. And the United Nations has raised concern about the fate of the more then 200000 people still living in rebel-held districts. It said relief supplies had already been stockpiled in the city but \"further life-saving aid is needed urgently.\"\n",

Syrian forces succeeded to kill 35 terrorists in an ambush operation in Eastern Ghouta in Damascus countryside Al-Alam News Network reports. The operation was carried out on Sunday night as the terrorists tried to infiltrate Jobar region in Eastern Ghouta. The Syrian army forces in cooperation with the popular forces surrounded the terrorists and attacked them in an ambush operation and killed 35 members of Jaish al-Islam and Filaq al-Rahman terrorist groups in a several-hour-long clashes. In a relevant development in Syria the army thwarted a series of attacks by the Takfiri terrorists on a strategic region in Aleppo province Northern Syria. The Takfiri terrorists were trying to attack a strategic region of Jamiat al-Zahra in Western Aleppo but they failed. Aleppo has been the scene of heavy clashes between the terrorists and the Syrian troops in the last several weeks. Also the Syrian army backed by popular defense forces seized back a strategic town in Hama province. The army units took control of al-Karima town before starting their advances towards Sahl al-Qab region in Western Hama. Al-Karima town is of strategic importance because it links the three provinces of Homs Idlib and Lattakia. The victory in Karima paves the way for the Syrian army to move towards Shal al-Qab region. Elsewhere the Syrian army and the Lebanese Hezbollah forces continued their advances in the Western parts of the town of al-Zobdani. Al-Zobdani is now the scene of fierce clashes between the Syrian and Lebanese forces and militants of Jeish al-Fath terrorist group.\n",

      "Original article:  19 Sep 2016 At least 10 people were killed on Sunday when barrel bombs were dropped by regime forces on an opposition-held town in Daraa. Smoke rises after an airstrike in the opposition-held town of Dael in Deraa Governorate Syria September 5 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) A fragile ceasefire between Bashar al Assads regime and Syrian opposition forces that was brokered by the US and Russia last week has ended with no word of a renewed truce on Monday. From the outset the week-long truce was marred by violations. Regime helicopters dropped four barrel bombs on an opposition-held town of Dael in the southern province of Daraa killing 10 people including a child the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported. People move an injured man inside a field hospital after an airstrike in the opposition-held town of Dael in Daraa Governorate Syria September 18 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) Airstrikes were also reported in Aleppo Syrias largest city and former commercial hub. There was no confirmation as to whether or not the Syrian regime or its allied Russian airforce both of which have oversight of Syrian airspace were responsible. The incidents came just a day after US-led coalition forces killed dozens of regime fighters south of Deir al Zor after mistaking them for DAESH terrorists triggering criticism from Moscow. The War In Syria Interview with Alexey Khlebnikov from Russia Direct on US strikes on regime forces - YouTube Russia has backed the Assad regime since the war in Syria began in 2011 while the US has long called on Assad to step down. The superpowers have been targeting DAESH with parallel military campaigns in Syria forcing the terrorist group to retreat from swathes of land it took control of across the country in 2013 and 2014. But the Syrian war has placed Washington and Moscow at loggerheads with Russia seeking to prop up the regime while US-led coalition airstrikes on DAESH aim to pave the way for US-backed groups to take control. Russian Sukhoi Su-34 fighter-bomber dropping off bombs in the Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor. (Reuters) Ceasefire failed and ended A number of violations on both sides have threatened the ceasefire. Zakaria Malahifji head of the political office of the Aleppo-based opposition group Fastaqim told Reuters he believed the truce had \"practically failed and has ended.\" Malahifji also expressed doubt that UN aid trucks stuck on the Turkish border would reach besieged areas of eastern Aleppo. \"There is no hope. It has been a number of days of procrastination. Every day there is a pretext. There is no hope of aid being delivered currently\" he said. Up to 300000 people in the opposition-held parts of Aleppo are running low on vital supplies due to siege by the regime which is yet to give permission to the 20-vehicle convoy waiting in the Turkish city of Gaziantep permission to cross into Syria. Now in Aleppo Syria regime blocking aid from Turkey without coordination with its agencies. pic.twitter.comtCdooEpBWg Joyce Karam (JoyceKaram) September 13 2016 \"I am pained and disappointed that a United Nations convoy has yet to cross into Syria from Turkey and safely reach eastern Aleppo\" the UN Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs Stephen OBrien said in a statement. Both sides have laid the blame on each other for ceasefire violations. On Sunday Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Major-General Igor Konashenkov in an emailed statement accused \"terrorists and the opposition\" of using the ceasefire to \"boost their forces and prepare for renewed hostilities\". Russia has also called for an emergency UN Security Council meeting after claiming over 60 regime fighters were killed by the US-led airstrikes on Saturday. The War In Syria Interview with Richard Weitz from Hudson Institute on incendiary strikes in Syria - YouTube In turn US Secretary of State John Kerry called on Russia to \"stop the grandstanding stop the showboating and get the humanitarian assistance going.\" \"Russias client Russias supported friend is the single biggest blockade to the ability to move forward here\" Kerry told CNN in reference to the regimes failure to grant access to the UN aid convoy.

The death toll reached 330 overnight civil defence sources told The New Arab as airstrikes targeted the citys opposition-controlled areas after midnight on Sunday. \"Hospitals that are still in service are under a lot of pressure due to the significant number of wounded in recent days and the major shortage of blood\" one medic told AFP. \"Because of this serious injuries are requiring immediate amputations.\" The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights placed the death toll lower saying \"at least 128 people\" nearly all civilians had been killed in the raids since Thursday. Among the dead were 20 children and nine women said Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman. At least 36 civilians including 11 children and five women were killed in raids targeting rural areas of Aleppo province he said. \t \tHospitals that are still in service are under a lot of pressure due to the significant number of wounded in recent days.\t \t Hospitals in rebel-held east Aleppo are struggling to deal with a huge number of casualties as supplies dwindle. Monday was the fourth day of intense air raids on the city after a defiant Syrian regime launched a new assault to retake the entirety of the city following the collapse of a short-lived ceasefire brokered by Russia and the United States. With Aleppo again under siege - regime forces fully surrounded the city in early September - residents have to deal with food shortages and skyrocketing prices as well as the increased violence. \t \tIn pictures Click here for Zouhir al-Shimales photoessay on East Aleppos empty marketplace The price of a portion of bread had risen to 500 Syrian pounds ($1) from 350 Syrian pounds last week and food is becoming increasingly difficult to find.

      "Original article:  12 February 2015 Free Syrian Army and Nusra Front fighters pushed from town of Deir al-Adas and surrounding areas as rebels claim Iranian-backed Lebanese group wants to set up permanent base. Hizballah fighters backed by Syrian and Iranian forces have pushed the Nusra Front and from the town of Deir al-Adas reports say in a major offensive in the Daraa governorate. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Deir al-Adas was taken on Tuesday after two days of fierce fighting between regime elements and rebels including members of Nusra al-Qaedas affiliate in Syria and fighters from the Free Syrian Army. The offensive is part of the operation launched on Sunday to seize areas at the intersection point of the three Syrian governorates of Rif Dimashq Daraa and Quneitra near the disputed Golan Heights. The observatory group said 20 opposition fighters were killed in the fighting including a Hizballah ambush near Deir al-Adas. The groups director Rami Abdulrahman told the AFP news agency that Hizballah was leading the attack on Deir al-Adas and its surrounding hills. Al-Araby al-Jadeed cannot independently verify the reports. Restoring security The official Syrian news agency Sana quoted a military source on Wednesday as saying the army was able to \"restore security\" to Sanei Tal al-Hawa and Tal-Arous in the southwestern countryside of Damascus Tal Meri west of Damascus and al-Danaji and Tal Antar near Deir al-Adas. The opposition Local Coordination Committee of Deir al-Adas said heavy shelling had forced the Free Syrian Army from the town which was now \"in range of their firepower\". Ayman al-Aasmi a member of the FSA southern front command claimed that Hizballah was trying to set up a permanent base in north Daraa to link its positions in southern Lebanon through the hills of Mount Hermon. \"The issue is not just about retaking some towns and hills\" he said. \"Hizballah pushed large forces into the battle mostly made up of Lebanese and Iraqi militias in light of the regime forces collapse in the Daraa governorate as a result of losses in battles with opposition forces defections or redeployment into the hot spots in other governorates.\" This article is an edited translation of the original Arabic.\n",

      "Original article:  Mon Jul 18 2016 21 Civilians Killed in US-Led Coalition Attacks in Northern Syria. Airstrikes by US-led coalition fighter jets have killed at least 21 civilians in northern Syrian territories held by the Daesh (ISIS ISIL) Takfiri terrorists a monitoring group says. The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Monday that at least 15 people were killed as the coalition carried out raids in a northern district of Manbij city. The UK-based group which advocates the Syrian opposition said six more people lost their lives in a village near Manbij after similar attacks by coalition fighter jets. The so-called multinational task force against ISIS started its controversial mission in Iraq in late 2014 after ISIS seized control over territories west and north of the country. The air campaign was later expanded to cover areas in northern Syria despite criticism from the Syrian government that the attacks violate the sovereignty of the Arab country. The United States claims the attacks are carried out to assist Syrian Kurds and Arabs fighting against ISIS in areas along the Turkish border in the province of Aleppo. However the attacks have led to numerous deaths among the civilians and Syrian military forces. The coalition attacks on Manbij intensified in late June after Kurds and Arabs from the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance failed in their drive to fully push back militants from the city. The SDF has attempted several times to advance from the western neighborhoods it has captured into the road south of Manbij which connects the strategic city to Raqqa the de facto capital of ISIS in Syria. Thousands have fled the fierce fighting in Manbij while tens of thousands more remain trapped in the city. The US and allies use the Incirlik air base in southern Turkey to bomb purported ISIS positions in northern Syria and Iraq Press TV reported. SSH 11\n",

      "Original article:  Saturday 27 February 2016 ISIS attacks Kurdish-held town on Turkish border. Coalition war planes carried out 10 air strikes to try to repel the assault the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. It said at least 45 Islamic State militants and 20 Kurdish militia fighters had been killed. ISIS militants launched an assault on a Kurdish-controlled town on Syrias border with Turkey on Saturday prompting air strikes by the U.S.-led coalition to try to drive them back. The hardline Sunni fighters attacked Tel Abyad which is controlled by the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia and the nearby town of Suluk in the early hours of Saturday YPG spokesman Redur Xelil and Turkish security sources told Reuters. Coalition war planes carried out 10 air strikes to try to repel the assault the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. It said at least 45 Islamic State militants and 20 Kurdish militia fighters had been killed. The attack was launched hours after a cessation of hostilities came into effect under a U.S.-Russian plan although the temporary truce does not apply to ISIS and Al-Qaeda affiliate the Nusra Front meaning the Syrian government Moscow and the coalition reserve the right to strike them. The truce appeared largely to be holding across much of Syria. Xelil said the YPG and Syrian Kurdish internal security forces were able to crush this attack and encircle the attackers although he gave no casualty toll. The YPG captured Tel Abyad from ISIS last year in an offensive backed by U.S.-led air strikes. The town lies north of Raqqa and had been a key supply line for the militant capital. The Turkish security sources said the attack was launched on two fronts and that the sound of gunfire and explosions audible from the town of Akcakale on the Turkish side had continued for several hours. Intermittent gunfire could still be heard. The security sources and a witness in Akcakale said war planes thought to be from the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS struck the militant positions and that the Turkish army had increased patrols on its side of the border. While not directly addressing the Tel Abyad attack 14 Turkish F-16s patrolled the Turkish-Syrian border on Friday Turkish military said. Xelil said some of the attackers infiltrated from the Turkish border to the north reiterating accusations that Turkey was supporting the group. Turkey has consistently denied those accusations and the security sources said recent measures to stop illegal crossings meant it was impossible that the attackers had entered from Turkey. Other attackers infiltrated from the south Xelil said. He said dozens of Islamic State fighters had been killed.\n",

      "Original article:  Death toll from Aleppo bus convoy bomb attack at least 126 Observatory The death toll from a bomb attack on a crowded bus convoy outside Aleppo has reached at least 126 in the deadliest such incident in Syria in almost a year the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said on Sunday. Syrian rescue workers of the Civil Defence said that they had taken away at least 100 bodies from the site of Saturdays blast which hit buses carrying Shiite residents as they waited to cross from rebel into government territory in an evacuation deal between the warring sides. The British-based Observatory said the number was expected to rise. Those killed were mostly residents of the villages of al-Foua and Kefraya in Idlib province but included rebel fighters guarding the convoy the Observatory said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack which pro-Damascus media said was carried out by a suicide car bomber. Syrias main armed opposition condemned the bombing with groups fighting under the banner of the Free Syrian Army describing it as a \"treacherous terrorist attack\". Pope Francis in an Easter message also condemned the attack describing it as \"ignoble\" and asking God to bring healing and comfort to what he called the \"beloved and martyred Syria\". The convoy was carrying at least 5000 people including civilians and several hundred pro-government fighters who were granted safe passage out of the two Shiite villages which are besieged by rebels. Under the evacuation deal more than 2000 people including rebel fighters were granted safe passage out of Madaya a town near Damascus besieged by government forces and their allies. That convoy was waiting at a bus garage in a government-held area on Aleppos outskirts a few miles from where the attack took place. Madaya evacuees said they heard the blast.\n",

Thirteen militants of the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Levant organization were killed Monday during battles with other opposition armed groups in Idlib countryside. Thirteen militants of the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Levant organization were killed Monday during battles with other opposition armed groups in Idlib countryside. The opposition UK-based Syrian observatory indicated that among the killed was a local Libyan emir who was killed during violent clashes with gunmen in the vicinity of Hazano town several kilometers away from the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey. Another seven people of a local armed group were also killed in the clash which took place after al-Qaeda terrorist organization members tried to arrest two persons of the town residents. Earlier ISIL gunmen seized the headquarters of al-Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra terrorist group in the Shaddadi area in Hasakah countryside north-east of the country. Moreover in Azaz situation is still unstable after recent clashes between the ISIL militiamen and Storm of North Brigade of the so-called free Syrian army. The free army accused the ISIL of violating the cease-fire agreement by abstaining from releasing many of the detainees. Recently fierce clashes erupted between the ISIL Al-Nusra Front and the free army in the wake of disputes on power and control sharing over areas not reclaimed so far by the Syrian army. The Syrian national military launched a wide-scale military operation in May 2013 in the countrys main provinces to restore security and release citizens from terrorist threats. Syria was hit by a violent unrest since mid-March 2011 where the Syrian government accuses foreign actors of orchestrating the conflict by supporting the militant opposition groups with arms and money. \n",

      "Original article:  Last updated at Oct 082017 MOSCOW Some 120 Daesh terror group extremists and 60 foreign mercenaries were killed in a series of Russian air strikes in Syria over the past 24 hours the defence ministry in Moscow said on Saturday. Puzzlingly the ministry also said three senior Daesh commanders including Omar Al Shishani had been confirmed dead as a result of an earlier Russian strike. Moscow reported Shishanis death despite the fact that the Pentagon said in 2016 the notorious fighter had been killed by American troops in Iraq. A command post of the terrorists and up to 80 [Daesh] fighters including nine natives of the Northern Caucasus were destroyed in the area of Mayadeen the ministry said adding that another 40 Daesh fighters were killed around the town of Albu Kamal. Mayadeen is one of Daeshs last bastions in Syria. In another air strike more than 60 foreign mercenaries from the former Soviet Union Tunisia and Egypt were killed in the Euphrates Valley south of Deir Ezzor. The ministry said large numbers of foreign mercenaries were coming into the Syrian border town of Albu Kamal from Iraq. It also said Russian forces had killed senior Daesh commanders Omar Al Shishani Alaa Al Din Al Shishani and Salah Al Din Al Shishani all natives of the Northern Caucasus. Moscow reported their deaths after taking several days to confirm the results of an earlier strike on the northern outskirts of Albu Kamal which destroyed a Daesh command post with more than 30 fighters including the natives of the Northern Caucasus. Omar the Chechen The Pentagon announced in March 2016 that American forces had killed Shishani one of the most notorious faces of Daesh known for his thick red beard. Shishani whose nom de guerre means Omar the Chechen came from the former Soviet state of Georgias Pankisi Gorge region which is populated mainly by ethnic Chechens. He fought as a Chechen rebel against Russian forces before joining the Georgian military in 2006 and fought Russian forces again in Georgia in 2008. He later resurfaced in northern Syria as the commander of a group of foreign fighters and became a senior leader within Daesh. The Russian defence ministry was not immediately available for further comment. Rami Abdel Rahman head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights disagreed with Moscows report. Salah Al Din Al Shishani is still alive and is somewhere in the regions controlled by extremist groups in the west of Aleppo province. He is a famous commander and his extremist group is allied with the extremists of Al Nusra Front but only in their fight against the regime he said. He has no links with Daesh The advances against Daesh in Deir Ezzor have resulted in a heavy civilian death toll through Russian and coalition air raids. The observatory said Russian air strikes on Thursday night killed 14 people including three children fleeing across the Euphrates on rafts near Mayadeen. Since it intervened in Syria in 2015 Russia has not acknowledged any civilian deaths from its strikes and it dismisses the observatorys reporting as biased. Moscow has been staging air strikes in support of its ally Damascus targeting both Daesh in Deir Ezzor province and rival extremists led by Al Qaedas former Syria affiliate in Idlib province in the northwest.\n",

      "Original article:  Date of publication 21 September 2016 Russian and regime warplanes confirmed by Civil DefenceUS officials as behind the \"deliberate attacks\" that targeted a UN-Red Crescent [SARC] convoy on Monday night killing scores of volunteers and civilians. Tags White Helmets SARC war crimes UN aid convoy Urum al-Kubra Aleppo Russian and regime warplanes were behind the \"deliberate attacks\" that targeted a UN-Red Crescent [SARC] convoy on Monday night killing scores of volunteers and civilians the Syrian Civil Defence confirmed in a statement late on Tuesday. The planes struck the convoy as trucks unloaded aid in the town of Urum al-Kubra west of Aleppo city then struck again as Civil Defence crews arrived on the scene the statement added. Fifteen SARC volunteers were killed in the \"double-tap\" strike said the Civil Defence also known as the White Helmets who were among the first responders and more than 25 were injured. The strikes also destroyed most of the aid. The statement described the attack as a crime insisting the whereabouts of the convoy were known to all parties. Earlier the UN decided to suspend all aid convoys in Syria pending the re-evaluation of the security situation following the attack on the convoy in Urum al-Kubra. Reuters quoting US officials said on Tuesday that two Russian Sukhoi SU-24 warplanes were in the skies above an aid convoy in Syria at the precise time it was struck on Monday. The officials were citing US intelligence that has led them to conclude Russia was to blame. According to a CNN report the US has reached the preliminary conclusion that Russian warplanes bombed an aid convoy and warehouse belonging to SARC. \"All the evidence we have points to that conclusion\" one of the officials said. The White House meanwhile said that Russia holds responsibility for the strike regardless of whether it was their planes that attacked. \"All of our information indicates clearly that this was an airstrike. That means there only could have been two entities responsible\" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said on Tuesday night naming Moscow and the Syrian regime. He didnt specify which countrys planes carried out the strike. \"We hold the Russian government responsible for airstrikes in this airspace given their commitment under the cessation of hostilities was to ground air operations where humanitarian assistance was flowing\" Rhodes said referring to the terms of a recent ceasefire brokered between the US and Russia. Russia has denied its aircraft or those of its Syrian government allies were involved in the incident in which 18 trucks from a 31-vehicle convoy were destroyed. The strike appeared to deal a fatal blow to Syrias fragile week-old ceasefire. Read Also\n",

Fresh fighting shook Aleppo on Saturday as rebels battled to break a siege of the city by the Syrian regime accused by Washington of using starvation as a weapon of war. Opposition fighters unleashed a barrage of rockets on the government-held western side of the divided city on Friday as they announced a major offensive aimed at reopening vital supply lines. \"In just a few days we will open the way for our besieged brothers\" rebel commander Abu Mustafa told AFP. The rebel fire has killed at least 21 civilians including two children according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. \"Fighting continues on the western outskirts of Aleppo where rebels have been making advances\" the British-based monitoring group which has a network of sources on the ground said Saturday. More than 1500 fighters from the provinces of Aleppo and Idlib to the west were attacking government-controlled districts of the city along a front stretching for 15 kilometres (nine miles) it said. The Observatory reported Russian air raids on Aleppos western front lines but said that a halt to Moscows aerial bombing of the rebel-held east of the city was holding. An AFP correspondent who visited Dahiyet al-Assad where rebels seized ground on Friday saw deserted streets and extensive damage to buildings as airstrikes and artillery fire hit the area. Fierce fighting shelling and car bombs killed at least 18 regime forces and allied fighters on Friday according to Observatory which was unable to provide a toll for the rebels. More than 250000 people live under government siege in the eastern half of Aleppo which the army began an operation to retake several weeks ago. Syrias second city Aleppo has been devastated by some of the heaviest fighting of the five-year civil war that began with anti-government protests and has since killed more than 300000 people. Much of the once-bustling economic hub has been reduced to rubble by air and artillery bombardment including barrel bombs - crude unguided explosive devices that cause indiscriminate damage.\n",

      "Original article:  10.10.2017(updated 1601 10.10.2017) Get short URL 1721 The Russian Aerospace Forces have destroyed a Daesh command center in Syrias Deir ez-Zor province and killed some 34 terrorists who entered the country from Iraqs western regions the Russian Defense Ministry said. The Russian aircraft carried out 182 airstrikes against the positions of Daesh terrorists in Syria in the past 24 hours the ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. A total of 70 Daesh terrorists who were later identified as nationals of CIS states and Algeria were eliminated in the Mayadin area according to Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov. The airstrikes were carried out after reconnaissance drones had discovered a large stronghold of Daesh terrorists on the eastern bank of the Euphrates river near the city of Mayadin. The terrorists had an artillery and tank projectiles depot as well as a ramified network of underground tunnels there. \"A Daesh command post and three groups of terrorists who arrived in the area from the territory of Iraq as a reinforcement were destroyed. The elimination of 34 militants the destruction of 5 SUVs with large-caliber weapons as well as 2 vehicles with ammunition has been confirmed\" Russian Konashenkov stated commenting on airstrikes near the village of Hatla in the Deir ez-Zor province. The spokesman went on by saying that a Russian Sukhoi Su-34 jet hit the same area 40 minutes later when Daesh militants arrived at the scene to evacuate wounded terrorists. As the result of that strike more militants were eliminated. Sputnik Dmitriy Vinogradov Russian Su-24 Warplane Crashes in Syria All Crew Members Dead Earlier in the day Konashenkov said that the US forces had reduced its anti-Daesh operation in Iraq as the Syria army was conducting an operation to liberate the Deir ez-Zor province from terrorists. The spokesman stressed that foreign mercenaries from Iraq use armored vehicles and pickups with weapons to provide daily replenishment to Daesh troops in the Syrian city of Mayadin. The city of Al Mayadin is the major Daesh stronghold in the neighboring province of Deir ez-Zor. Terrorists have used this hub to accumulate weapons and manpower to launch attacks on the cities of Palmyra and Deir ez-Zor. It was reported earlier that the Syrian army was conducting an operation to encircle Daesh militants in Mayadin. Lately Syrian forces have been on the offensive in the area around the city of Deir ez-Zor. Most militants have been pushed back several miles east and across the Euphrates. Daesh militants then started fleeing for Mayadin and further toward the northern outskirts of Deir ez-Zor.\n",

      "Original article:  Tuesday 02 August 2016 19:11 Syrian Coalition Demands UN Action under Chapter VII Following Regime Chlorine Attacks on Saraqib Idlib Twitter font size Activists said regime forces bombed the town of Saraqib in rural Idlib with chlorine-filled barrel bombs on Monday causing over 30 cases of asphyxiation among civilians. The attacks were carried out in a blatant violation of UN Security Council resolutions 2118 and 2235 banning the use of chemical weapons and toxic substances. In a press release issued earlier on Tuesday the Syrian Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to shoulder its responsibilities towards stopping such attacks. It stressed that urgent measures must be taken under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations to protect the Syrian people. Any further delay in taking firm stance towards such attacks will open the door to more crimes and violations by the Assad regime the Coalition said. Separately over 12 civilians were killed and dozens injured including women and children when Russian jets raided the village of Abu Alduhour in rural Idlib on Monday. Five civilians were also killed in similar attacks on the village of Tal Toughan in rural Idlib. Activists said that the bombings were carried out by Russian forces in revenge for the death of five crewmen killed when their helicopter crashed near the town of Saraqib on Monday. The Syrian Coalition emphasized the need for the international community to assume its responsibilities regarding the protection of civilians in accordance with International Law (IL) and International Humanitarian Law (IHL) to stop war crimes and eliminate the constant threat of the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime.

She and her daughter are dead along with another family\" Abu Mohammad told AFP. \"There was no military base here. All the military positions are outside the town\" the devastated man said. Another man and a woman were killed in rocket fire in the nearby town of Kafr Awid. Idlib province is controlled by the Jaish al-Fatah an alliance of rebel groups and militants including the Fateh al-Sham Front which changed its name from al-Nusra Front after breaking off ties with al-Qaeda.

Tags Aleppo civil defence UN airstrikes Russia Airstrikes in opposition areas of Syrias northern Aleppo province struck a market a hospital and a village on Friday killing at least 18 people including children and two hospital staffers. The air raids hit the only hospital for women and children in the town of Kafr Hamra before dawn killing two staffers including a nurse. The Syrian Civil Defence a group of first responders said it pulled 10 people alive from under the rubble. Kafr Hamra is near the northern front line in the deeply divided city of Aleppo where government troops have sealed the main route into opposition areas effectively trapping nearly 300000 residents. The Syrian Civil Defence said one of its centres in the rebel-held part of Aleppo was hit. Pictures on the groups Facebook page showed serious damage to one of its vehicles and crumbling walls. The volunteer group said one of its most well-known members died after being buried under the rubble following a Wednesday airstrike in the Ramouseh area recently seized by rebels from government forces. Khaled Harah had recovered a live baby from a destroyed building in Aleppos Sukkari neighbourhood in 2014 following a 16-hour rescue effort. \"It was a miracle\" said Bibars Mishal a colleague of Harah in Aleppo. Harah was later invited to the UN Security Council to testify about the violence in Aleppo. Mishal said Harahs body was pulled from the rubble on Thursday. Read more here Syrian miracle baby saver killed in Aleppo The opposition fighters launched a counteroffensive last week breaching the siege from the south. That road remains under fire and the UN has asked for a cease-fire to allow aid into the area. Health facilities have been frequently targeted in the civil war in Syria. Aid groups have said the month of July was one of the worst since the war began in 2011 with some 43 facilities in opposition areas partially or totally destroyed. Despite calls for a ceasefire and Russias promise of a three-hour daily respite from airstrikes to allow in humanitarian aid there has been no let-up in the violence. During the day Friday airstrikes hit a market in the nearby town of Urem al-Kubra killing at least six people according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which relies on activists on the ground. Urem al-Kubra lies on the road linking Aleppo to the northern rebel-controlled province of Idlib which has also seen intense bombing. In the northern Aleppo countryside at least 10 people were killed including children and women when airstrikes hit the village of Hayan. It was not clear what the target was but videos shared by activists of the scene of the attack show the bodies of women and children strewn on the side of the road as frantic residents scramble to recover them. The Local Coordination Committees an activist collective said outdoor Friday prayers were called off in Idlib because of the intensity of the airstrikes. Germany meanwhile called for UN-supervised humanitarian access to Aleppo saying Russias unilateral three-hour daily cease-fire isnt enough. Russia has been carrying out airstrikes to bolster Syrian government forces since last September. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was quoted as telling Fridays edition of the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that \"humanitarian access cant be under the single-handed control of one side of the conflict.\" \"A unilaterally declared three-hour cease-fire per day isnt enough to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe\" he said.

      "Original article:  Wed Feb 17 2016 More than 100 Terrorists Killed in Syrian Army Operations across Country. More than 100 Takfiri terrorists have been killed in two days of air and ground operations by the Syrian military across the Arab country. Syrias official news agency SANA reported on Wednesday that Syrian fighter jets targeted hideouts of the Takfiri Daesh terrorists in the town of al-Bab and several other villages in the northeastern countryside of Aleppo Province. The report said at least 70 terrorists were slain. The Syrian aircraft also dealt a heavy blow to the Takfiri militants in airstrikes on their command posts in Eastern Ghouta on the outskirts of the capital Damascus. The Syrian forces recently regained control of several areas in the same region. Also on Wednesday airstrikes by the Syrian air force targeted gathering centers of militants of the Jaish al-Fatah in Kafr Zita Jub al-Rayan and Kafr Nabudah in the northern countryside of Hama. Jaish al-Fateh terrorists suffered another blow in similar strikes on their hideouts in the province of Idlib. On Tuesday at least six Takfiri militants were killed in attacks by the Syrian ground forces in the provinces of Hama and Idlib. Separately the Syrian army released footage showing the operation of liberating two strategic villages in Aleppo. The villages of Masqan and Ehras in the northern countryside of Aleppo were liberated from the control of the Takfiri militants on Monday. The army backed by popular forces also won back the village of al-Tiba in the eastern countryside of Aleppo as well as Kafar Naya 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of Aleppo City. The Syrian army and its allies backed by Russian warplanes have recently made major advances against Takfiri militants north of Aleppo. Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi said on February 10 that the government forces will soon take full control of the militant-held areas of Aleppo but predicted a tough battle for the largest city in the Arab country. \"These battles are not easy but the day will come God willing when all Aleppo - its rural areas and the occupied part of the city - will return to state authority\" Zoubi said. Syria has been gripped by foreign-backed militancy since March 2011. According to a new report by the Syrian Center for Policy Research the conflict has claimed the lives of over 470000 people injured 1.9 million others and displaced nearly half of the countrys pre-war population of about 23 million within or beyond its borders Press TV reported.

      "Original article:  6 July 2015 So called Islamic State group has posted online a new disturbing video showing the murder of two Syrian activists after they confess to spying. Tags Syria Islamic State activists murder video Palmyra The Islamic State group has released a new video purporting to show the killing of two Syrian activists in the militants stronghold of Raqqa allegedly for spying on the extremists. IS has killed hundreds of people since it declared an Islamic caliphate in June last year with the city of Raqqa as its de facto capital. The video which was posted Monday on an IS-linked Facebook page shows two young men in orange jumpsuits who say they filmed and photographed IS-held areas in Syria and sent footage to a person abroad. They identify themselves as 21-year-old Faysal Hussein Habibi and 20-year-old Bishr Abdul-Azim. They are then tied to a tree after which masked gunmen shoot them in the head at close range. This follows the release of a video posted online n 4 July purportedly showing Islamic State fighters killing 25 Syrian soldiers in the historic town of Palmyra in central Syria. \t \tScores of Syrian troops and state employees were killed in the days after Palmyra fell to IS. The video showed the soldiers being taken in pickup trucks from the towns notorious Tadmur prison to the amphitheatre. At the theatre they were shot dead by young IS members armed with pistols. Hundreds of people were seen watching the killings. The video did not indicate when the killings took place. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said these shootings took place on 27 May. It was reported in May that scores of Syrian troops and state employees were murdered in the days after the town fell to IS on 22 May 2015. Palmyra is a UNESCO world heritage site famous for its 2000-year-old Roman colonnades other ruins and priceless artifacts. The capture of Palmyra has raised concern that the militants might try to destroy one of the Middle Easts most spectacular archaeological sites a well-preserved Roman-era city on the towns edge as they have destroyed other pre-Islamic ancient monuments elsewhere in Syria and Iraq. On 2 July IS said its militants had destroyed six archaeological pieces from Palmyra that were confiscated from a smuggler. The shootings in the video took place inside the archaeological site and the troops some of whom had bruises and blood on their faces apparently as a result of being beaten were made to kneel in front of a giant IS black flag before being shot in the back of their heads.\n",

      "Original article:  Jihadists execute three Syria rebel officers Monitor AFP Saturday 21 Jun 2014 Jihadists from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) have executed three officers of the Western and Arab-backed rebel Free Syrian Army a monitor said Saturday. The bullet-riddled bodies of the three were found on Friday two days after suspected Islamist militants kidnapped them in the oil-rich eastern province of Deir Ezzor said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. ISIL which grew from the ranks of Al-Qaeda before splitting with the global terror network is active in both Syria and neighbouring Iraq and seeks to set up an Islamic state that straddles both countries. But the radical group has faced a major backlash from other rebels fighting to topple the Syrian regime and from Al-Qaedas affiliate in Syria Al-Nusra Front amid accusations of atrocities in Syrias three-year war. The FSA this month called for help from \"friendly and brotherly Arab nations\" to fight ISIL in Deir Ezzor. Rebels in Syria including Al-Nusra Front militants have been battling ISIL since the start of the year in fighting that has reportedly killed more than 6000 people. The clashes have mostly raged in the north and east of the country and on Friday ISIL seized control of the areas of Hafez and Muhassen in Deir Ezzor. The FSA officers executed by the jihadists had been kidnapped in Hafez the Britain-based Observatory said. ISIL has been battling Iraqi government forces since June 9 when in launched a lightening offensive in the north of the country.\n",

(presstv) - At least 45 people have been killed in the US latest airstrike in Syria. According to local sources on Monday the civilians were killed after US jets targeted the al-Touseeiyah district in the city of Raqqah. The incident comes just one day after the so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that more than 3000 people including nearly 1000 civilians have been killed during the past month. The US-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against what are said to be Isis targets inside Syria since September 2014 without any authorization from the Damascus government or a UN mandate. The military alliance has repeatedly been accused of targeting and killing civilians. It has also been largely incapable of achieving its declared goal of destroying Isis. The Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates in two separate letters sent to UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres and rotating President of the UN Security Council Amr Abdellatif Aboulatta on August 24 stated that the US-led coalition was perpetrating war crimes and crimes against humanity through aerial bombardment of residential neighborhoods.

Nearly 75 terrorist killed including 30 foreign-sponsored Takfiri terrorists and nore than 100 wounded in offensive they had unsuccessfully launched to reopen a key supply route into the Syrian northern city of Aleppo. The London Based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced on Sunday that militants from the Nusra Front (Syrian branch of al-Qaeda) and its allied terrorists of Faylaq al-Sham mounted an attack to recapture the strategic Castello Road on Thursday. It added that Syrian army soldiers launched a counter-offensive killing 29 extremists and foiling their attack. The attack has ended and the road remains completely closed said Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman. The Castello Road was effectively severed by Syrian forces Thursday when they seized a hilltop within firing range of the key supply route. By Saturday the army soldiers were within 500 meters of the road and firing on any vehicle attempting to use it. The capture of the Castello Road came in the wake of recent recapture of al-Mallah Farms area northwest of Aleppo by the Syrian army in the. The capture of Mallah Farms and Castello Road enabled Syrian forces to besiege militant-held neighborhoods of Aleppo and puts them within the firing range of the army. 12\n",

      "Original article:  Date of publication 30 September 2017 Four children are among the 28 dead in overnight airstrikes on the town of Armanaz in Idlib province purportedly carried out by Syrian regime or Russian jets. Tags Syria Russia Idlib safe zone Turkey Assad SOHR At least 28 civilians were killed in airstrikes on northwestern Syria despite a planned safe zone. Four children were among the dead in the overnight strikes on the town of Armanaz in Idlib province near the Turkish border the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based watchdog had earlier reported 12 dead in the strikes on the town in Harem district around 20 kilometres northwest of the provincial capital Idlib. Entire apartment blocks had been flattened by the bombardment an AFP correspondent said. The Observatory said it could not immediately determine whether the strikes had been carried out by jets of the Syrian regime or its ally Russia. But they are the latest in an intensifying air campaign carried out by the two governments against jihadist fighters who control most of the province and are not party to a safe zone deal brokered by Russia Turkey and Iran. The surge in bombing raids has forced hospitals in the province to close medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said on Friday. They were triggered by an offensive by jihadist fighters led by al-Qaedas former Syria affiliate launched against regime-held villages in neighbouring Hama province on September 19. The jihadists control nearly all of Idlib province after driving out Islamist former allies earlier this year. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed on Thursday to step up efforts to establish a safe zone in Idlib as part of a wider agreement struck in May. Three other safe zones have already been set up - in Eastern Ghouta near Damascus parts of the south and some areas of the central province of Homs. But in some of those areas too the fighting has continued. Shelling by the army killed at least 21 civilians in Eastern Ghouta on Saturday more than half of them children the Observatory said. The de-escalation agreement excludes both the Islamic State group and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham the alliance dominated by al-Qaedas former Syrian affiliate. The Islamic State group is under attack in its remaining strongholds in eastern Syria by both Russian-backed government forces and US-backed fighters. On Thursday it mounted a counterattack against government forces along their supply lines through the desert to the eastern city of Deir Ezzor. At least 128 troops and militia were killed on Thursday and Friday as the army battled to restore control the Observatory said. State media have reported the IS counterattack but have made no mention of the armys losses. Read Also\n",

Decrying an affront to humanity President Donald Trump declared Wednesday that a chemical weapons attack in Syria cannot be tolerated but did not say what the US might do in response. He blamed the attack squarely on Syrian President Bashar Assad. Trump speaking alongside Jordans King Abdullah II in the Rose Garden offered no details about what steps the US might take in response even as his UN ambassador Nikki Haley was promising a strong and perhaps even unilateral response. But Trump said the attack was so horrific and noted that it had killed innocent people small children and even beautiful little babies. These heinous actions by the Assad regime cannot be tolerated Trump said. He said the US stood with its global allies to condemn this horrific attack. The United States and Russia were trading conflicting assertions Wednesday about who launched a chemical weapons attack in Syria that killed 72 people as world leaders grasped for a response to the latest atrocity in Syrias intractable civil war. President Donald Trump accompanied by first lady Melania Trump and Queen Rania shakes hands with Jordans King Abdullah II in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington Wednesday April 5 2017. (AP) As Trump stood by his charge that Assads forces were responsible Russia disagreed. The staunch Assad ally insisted that the chemicals were dispersed when Syrian warplanes bombed a facility where rebels were building chemical weapons. At the United Nations Trumps envoy threatened unilateral US action if the world body failed to act. When the United Nations consistently fails in its duty to act collectively there are times in the life of states that we are compelled to take our own action Haley declared. She addressed an emergency meeting of the Security Council which was weighing a resolution condemning chemical weapons use in Syria. Russia which has veto power is opposed. Yet in Moscow Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova focused her attention elsewhere: Its necessary to demand that the rebels offer full access to study the area and collect necessary information. Leaders and officials in other countries including Britain and Israel joined the US in saying Assads forces were responsible. A US official said an American review of radar and other assessments showed Syrian aircraft flying in the area at the time of the attack. Russian and coalition aircraft were not there at that time said the official who wasnt authorized to discuss intelligence publicly and requested anonymity. Washington hasnt yet concluded what type of chemical was used. On Tuesday President Donald Trump split the blame between Syrias embattled leader and former President Barack Obama for the countrys worst chemical weapons attack in years. While calling the attack reprehensible and intolerable Trump said Obama did nothing after Assad crossed the former US leaders red line in 2013. These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the past administrations weakness and irresolution Trump said. The political tone of Trumps statement took many US officials by surprise. They noted that US presidents have rarely attacked their predecessors so aggressively for events like chemical weapons attacks that Democrats and Republicans both abhor. Several officials involved in internal administration discussions said Trumps National Security Council had been preparing a different statement until the presidents closest advisers took over the process. The officials werent authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity. The presidents eldest daughter and top adviser Ivanka Trump took a more compassionate tone tweeting Wednesday Heartbroken and outraged by the images coming out of Syria following the atrocious chemical attack yesterday.

Food production in Syria at all-time low Food production has dropped to an all-time low in Syria where civilians are struggling through their sixth winter in a war zone UN agencies said on Tuesday. Many farmers have had to abandon their land unable to afford the soaring cost of seeds fertilizers and tractor fuel the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme said. Wheat output - vital for making flat loaves of bread a staple of the Syrian diet - dropped from an average 3.4 million metric tonnes harvested before the war began in 2011 to 1.5 million this year they said in a joint statement. Play Video The area planted for cereals in the 2015-16 cropping season is the smallest ever they added citing field visits and surveys that also showed record low production of barley. Food production in Syria has hit a record low due to fighting and insecurity but also weather conditions World Food Programme spokeswoman Bettina Luescher told a news briefing in Geneva. Food shortages are particularly worrying in east Aleppo the rebel-held part of the city besieged by government forces where the UN says 250000-275000 civilians still live. The last food rations provided by the UN have been given out (in east Aleppo). It is very hard to say how people will be coping there. Of course it is a very different situation in the capital where food is available at the markets and people can buy things Luescher said. Before the war Syria was an exporter of livestock. Now herds and flocks have shrunk there are 30 percent fewer cattle 40 percent fewer sheep and goats and a staggering 60 percent less poultry which of course is the most affordable source of animal protein Luescher said. More than 7 million people in Syria are classified as food insecure meaning they are not always sure where their next meal is coming from she added.

Seventeen civilians including eight children were killed in air raids on a market in eastern Syria on Monday the first day of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights [SOHR] said the strikes on al-Asharah a town held by the Islamic State group [IS] in Deir Az-Zour province. \"The market was overcrowded on Monday because people were shopping for Ramadan\" SOHR chief Rami Abdel Rahman said in a televised interview. He said many of those killed were from the same family and that the death toll was likely to rise because of the serious condition of some of the wounded. Local activist Amir al-Huwaidi told The New Arab that the attack was most likely carried out by Russian warplanes. Heavy air raids hit IS-held areas in and outside the divided city of Deir Az-Zour from early on Monday. IS controls more than 60 percent of the city besieging an estimated 200000 people there. The Islamic militant group also controls most of the surrounding oil-rich province by the same name. The SOHR relies on a network of sources inside Syria to gather its information on the five-year conflict which has killed more than 280000 people and displaced millions. It says it determines whether strikes were carried out by Syrian Russian or US-led coalition aircraft based on the location of the raids flight patterns and the types of planes and munitions involved. Russia began carrying out strikes in Syria in September 2015 one year after the United States began its air campaign there.

The attack on the town of Khan Sheikhun killed at least 58 civilians and saw dozens suffering respiratory problems and symptoms including vomiting fainting and foaming at the mouth the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said. Syrias opposition blamed President Bashar Assads forces saying the attack cast doubt on the future of peace talks. The army denied any involvement however issuing a statement blaming \"terrorist groups\" for using \"chemical and toxic substances\". At least 11 children were among the dead the observatory said and an AFP correspondent in Khan Sheikhun saw many attached to respirators. If confirmed it would be one of the worst chemical attacks since the start of Syrias civil war six years ago. The incident brought swift international condemnation with the United States France and Britain all pointing the finger at Assad. US blames Damascus The White House condemned what it said was a \"reprehensible\" attack carried out by Assads forces. Spokesman Sean Spicer said President Donald Trump had been briefed extensively on the incident adding that the US was \"confident in its assessment\" that Damascus was to blame. Spicer also suggested it was in the \"best interest\" of Syrians for Assad not to lead the country. UN envoy Staffan de Mistura said the attack was believed to be chemical and launched from the air adding that there should be a \"clear identification of responsibilities and accountability\". The observatory said the attack on a residential part of Khan Sheikhun came early on Tuesday morning when a warplane carried out strikes that released \"toxic gas\". As well as those killed at least 160 people were injured it said and many were dying even after arriving at medical facilities. The monitor could not confirm the nature of the gas but said the attack was likely carried out by government warplanes. We heard strikes this morning... We ran inside the houses and saw whole families just dead in their beds. Children women old people dead in the streets resident Abu Mustafa said. Russias military which has been fighting in support of Assads government since September 2015 denied carrying out any strikes near the town. Hours after the initial attack air strikes also hit a hospital in the town where doctors were treating victims the AFP correspondent said bringing down rubble on top of medics as they worked. He saw a young girl a woman and two elderly people dead at a hospital. A father carried his dead little girl her lips blueish and her dark curls visible wrapped in a sheet. As doctors worked a warplane circled overhead striking first near the facility and then hitting it twice inflicting severe damage and prompting nearly a dozen medical staff to flee. Speaking to AFP medic Hazem Shehwan said victims were suffering from symptoms including pinpoint pupils convulsions foaming at the mouth and rapid pulses. Army denial Khan Sheikhun is in Idlib province which is largely controlled by an alliance of rebels including former Al Qaeda affiliate Fateh Al Sham Front. The province is regularly targeted in government and Russian air strikes and has also been hit by the US-led coalition fighting Daesh group usually targeting extremists. Syrias leading opposition group the National Coalition blamed Assad for the attack and demanded the UN open an immediate investigation and hold those responsible to account. Failure to do so will be understood as a message of blessing to the regime for its actions it said. Damascus officially joined the Chemical Weapons Convention and turned over its declared chemical arsenal in 2013 as part of a deal to avert US military action. That agreement came after hundreds of people up to 1429 according to a US intelligence report were killed in chemical weapons strikes allegedly carried out by government troops east and southwest of Damascus. But there have been repeated allegations of chemical weapons use since with a UN-led investigation pointing the finger at the regime for at least three chlorine attacks in 2014 and 2015. The army again denied using chemical weapons on Tuesday insisting it has never used them any time anywhere and will not do so in the future. The global chemical arms watchdog said it was seriously concerned by reports of the attack. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it was gathering and analysing information from all available sources. The UNs Commission of Inquiry for Syria said it had begun investigating the alleged use of chemical weapons. Peace talks doubts More than 320000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests. Successive rounds of peace talks including a UN-sponsored meeting in Geneva last week have failed to produce a political breakthrough. Tuesdays attack cast new doubt on the peace process said the oppositions chief negotiator Mohamad Sabra. If the United Nations cannot deter the regime from carrying out such crimes how can it achieve a process that leads to political transition in Syria? he told AFP. A senior Syrian security source told AFP that opposition forces were trying to achieve in the media what they could not achieve on the ground by spreading images from the alleged attack site. The UN Security Council is to hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss the attack following calls from France and Britain. Ive seen the reports about the use of sarin and as far as I know they have not been confirmed the British ambassador to the UN Matthew Rycroft said.

The Syrian regime has intensified its campaign against the last rebel holdouts on the outskirts of the capital as Russian-sponsored talks in Kazakhstan aim to consolidate de-escalation zones in different parts of the country. The limited local truces are aimed at freezing the lines of the six-year-old civil war which has claimed an estimated 400000 lives and allowing humanitarian aid to flow into besieged areas. The Ghouta Media Center and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least five children were killed when a shell landed at the gate of a school in Jisreen a town in the eastern Ghouta suburbs of Damascus as children were leaving for the day. The Observatory said the death toll is likely to rise and that another child was killed in the village from another shell. One of the children had his legs blown off. Shelling in the northeastern town of Musraba has meanwhile killed another three people including a child according to the Observatory. The Ghouta Media Center said four were killed including two children. Another shell in Harasta also in the eastern Ghouta suburbs landed near a school but only caused injuries. Eastern Ghouta which is still home to an estimated 350000 people has endured years of siege and shelling which has continued despite a de-escalation agreement backed by the regime and its close allies Russia and Iran. On Monday the United Nations said it reached thousands of residents for the first time in over a month. The area is one of the last remaining pockets of opposition to regime leader Assad and depends on aid and smuggling. Rebels have responded to the shelling with a barrage of mortars lobbed at regime-held districts in Damascus wounding at least 10 civilians in three neighbourhoods. The rebels and the regime are meanwhile set to conclude the latest round of talks in the Kazakh capital Astana. The negotiations are sponsored by Turkey which backs the rebels as well as Russia and Iran. The de-escalation zones agreed to in Astana have significantly reduced the violence in many parts of Syria but a lasting political solution remains elusive.

Near the Turkish-Syrian border many civilians had fled their houses to avoid the battles raging in the vicinity. They sought refuge in a clump of \"clay and adobe\" homes in the nearby village of Tokhar Amnesty International said. US-led air strikes targeted the group taking out many of the women children and families who sought shelter there. This is the largest instance of civilian casualties since the US-led coalition began its bombing campaign in Syria in 2014. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a monitoring group based in the UK reported that the air strikes mistakenly identified and targeted the civilians as DAESH terrorists. The incident comes after another report of a strike killing \"a woman with four of her children and an old man\" in a separate part of the same city on Sunday the Observatory said. Recently the SDF a US-backed group mainly consisting of YPG militants associated with the PKK terrorist organisation concentrated their forces upon the strategically important city in an attempt to seize it from DAESH which took Manbij in 2014. The Syrian civil war began in mid 2011 when protests against autocrat Bashar al Assad and his regime were suppressed violently in the context of the Arab Spring uprisings. Since then the UN has estimated that nearly half of the countrys population has been forced to leave their homes and the death toll may be as high as 400000.

(TRT World and Agencies) The US military is investigating reports that at least 73 civilians mostly women and children were killed in air strikes early on Tuesday morning in the northern Syrian village of Tokhar part of the city of Manbij in the governorate of Aleppo. Near the Turkish-Syrian border many civilians had fled their houses to avoid the battles raging in the vicinity. They sought refuge in a clump of \"clay and adobe\" homes in the nearby village of Tokhar Amnesty International said. US-led air strikes targeted the group taking out many of the women children and families who sought shelter there. This is the largest instance of civilian casualties since the US-led coalition began its bombing campaign in Syria in 2014. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a monitoring group based in the UK reported that the air strikes mistakenly identified and targeted the civilians as DAESH terrorists. The incident comes after another report of a strike killing \"a woman with four of her children and an old man\" in a separate part of the same city on Sunday the Observatory said. Recently the SDF a US-backed group mainly consisting of YPG militants associated with the PKK terrorist organisation concentrated their forces upon the strategically important city in an attempt to seize it from DAESH which took Manbij in 2014. The Syrian civil war began in mid 2011 when protests against autocrat Bashar al Assad and his regime were suppressed violently in the context of the Arab Spring uprisings. Since then the UN has estimated that nearly half of the countrys population has been forced to leave their homes and the death toll may be as high as 400000.

Shocking recent AFP images from the region showed severely underweight children and doctors reported two infants had died of malnutrition and related complications. On Monday dozens of trucks carrying aid for 40000 people entered Eastern Ghouta. The region was once a prime agricultural region famed for its orchards. But the rebel stronghold has been under a tight government siege since 2013 causing shortages of food and medicine as well as price hikes for the local and smuggled supplies available. Basic services are virtually non-existent with electricity produced only by generators and water often dirty and a vector for disease. More than 330000 people have been killed in Syria since the war began in March 2011 with anti-government protests. The conflict has since spiralled into a complex war involving world powers and the Daesh terror group extremists who took over large swathes of the country in 2014. But the extremists have since lost most of the territory they controlled and were ousted two weeks ago from their de facto Syrian capital of Raqqa.
