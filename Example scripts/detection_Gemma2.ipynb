Food production in Syria at all-time low Food production has dropped to an all-time low in Syria where civilians are struggling through their sixth winter in a war zone UN agencies said on Tuesday. Many farmers have had to abandon their land unable to afford the soaring cost of seeds fertilizers and tractor fuel the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme said. Wheat output - vital for making flat loaves of bread a staple of the Syrian diet - dropped from an average 3.4 million metric tonnes harvested before the war began in 2011 to 1.5 million this year they said in a joint statement. Play Video The area planted for cereals in the 2015-16 cropping season is the smallest ever they added citing field visits and surveys that also showed record low production of barley. Food production in Syria has hit a record low due to fighting and insecurity but also weather conditions World Food Programme spokeswoman Bettina Luescher told a news briefing in Geneva. Food shortages are particularly worrying in east Aleppo the rebel-held part of the city besieged by government forces where the UN says 250000-275000 civilians still live. The last food rations provided by the UN have been given out (in east Aleppo). It is very hard to say how people will be coping there. Of course it is a very different situation in the capital where food is available at the markets and people can buy things Luescher said. Before the war Syria was an exporter of livestock. Now herds and flocks have shrunk there are 30 percent fewer cattle 40 percent fewer sheep and goats and a staggering 60 percent less poultry which of course is the most affordable source of animal protein Luescher said. More than 7 million people in Syria are classified as food insecure meaning they are not always sure where their next meal is coming from she added. The World Food Programme is distributing rations to more than 4 million people in Syria each month.

This attack is meant to be against the entire Kurdish region on the pretext of fighting the PKK Khalil said stressing that Kurds will fight those who attack them. The PYD the Syrian franchise of the Turkish PKK is believed to stand as the largest political and military formation in Syria and has assumed control over the Kurdish-dominated areas to the east and north of Syria since July 2012 setting up checkpoints and running public affairs. Khalil reaffirmed to Asharq Al-Awsat the PYDs despire to topple the regime as well as its opposition to the Al-Qaeda-linked rebel groups such as the Al-Nusra Front. We did not want to go into battles with the Islamists particularly after the agreement we signed with them but today they are laying siege to us in addition to the siege laid by the Syrian regime on the one hand and Turkey along the borders on the other the PYD spokesman said.

The attack on the town of Khan Sheikhun killed at least 58 civilians and saw dozens suffering respiratory problems and symptoms including vomiting fainting and foaming at the mouth the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said. Syrias opposition blamed President Bashar Assads forces saying the attack cast doubt on the future of peace talks. The army denied any involvement however issuing a statement blaming \"terrorist groups\" for using \"chemical and toxic substances\". At least 11 children were among the dead the observatory said and an AFP correspondent in Khan Sheikhun saw many attached to respirators. If confirmed it would be one of the worst chemical attacks since the start of Syrias civil war six years ago. The incident brought swift international condemnation with the United States France and Britain all pointing the finger at Assad. US blames Damascus The White House condemned what it said was a \"reprehensible\" attack carried out by Assads forces. Spokesman Sean Spicer said President Donald Trump had been briefed extensively on the incident adding that the US was \"confident in its assessment\" that Damascus was to blame. Spicer also suggested it was in the \"best interest\" of Syrians for Assad not to lead the country. UN envoy Staffan de Mistura said the attack was believed to be chemical and launched from the air adding that there should be a \"clear identification of responsibilities and accountability\". The observatory said the attack on a residential part of Khan Sheikhun came early on Tuesday morning when a warplane carried out strikes that released \"toxic gas\". As well as those killed at least 160 people were injured it said and many were dying even after arriving at medical facilities. The monitor could not confirm the nature of the gas but said the attack was likely carried out by government warplanes. We heard strikes this morning... We ran inside the houses and saw whole families just dead in their beds. Children women old people dead in the streets resident Abu Mustafa said. Russias military which has been fighting in support of Assads government since September 2015 denied carrying out any strikes near the town. Hours after the initial attack air strikes also hit a hospital in the town where doctors were treating victims the AFP correspondent said bringing down rubble on top of medics as they worked. He saw a young girl a woman and two elderly people dead at a hospital. A father carried his dead little girl her lips blueish and her dark curls visible wrapped in a sheet. As doctors worked a warplane circled overhead striking first near the facility and then hitting it twice inflicting severe damage and prompting nearly a dozen medical staff to flee. Speaking to AFP medic Hazem Shehwan said victims were suffering from symptoms including pinpoint pupils convulsions foaming at the mouth and rapid pulses. Army denial Khan Sheikhun is in Idlib province which is largely controlled by an alliance of rebels including former Al Qaeda affiliate Fateh Al Sham Front. The province is regularly targeted in government and Russian air strikes and has also been hit by the US-led coalition fighting Daesh group usually targeting extremists. Syrias leading opposition group the National Coalition blamed Assad for the attack and demanded the UN open an immediate investigation and hold those responsible to account. Failure to do so will be understood as a message of blessing to the regime for its actions it said. Damascus officially joined the Chemical Weapons Convention and turned over its declared chemical arsenal in 2013 as part of a deal to avert US military action. That agreement came after hundreds of people up to 1429 according to a US intelligence report were killed in chemical weapons strikes allegedly carried out by government troops east and southwest of Damascus. But there have been repeated allegations of chemical weapons use since with a UN-led investigation pointing the finger at the regime for at least three chlorine attacks in 2014 and 2015. The army again denied using chemical weapons on Tuesday insisting it has never used them any time anywhere and will not do so in the future. The global chemical arms watchdog said it was seriously concerned by reports of the attack. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it was gathering and analysing information from all available sources. The UNs Commission of Inquiry for Syria said it had begun investigating the alleged use of chemical weapons. Peace talks doubts More than 320000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests. Successive rounds of peace talks including a UN-sponsored meeting in Geneva last week have failed to produce a political breakthrough. Tuesdays attack cast new doubt on the peace process said the oppositions chief negotiator Mohamad Sabra. If the United Nations cannot deter the regime from carrying out such crimes how can it achieve a process that leads to political transition in Syria? he told AFP. A senior Syrian security source told AFP that opposition forces were trying to achieve in the media what they could not achieve on the ground by spreading images from the alleged attack site. The UN Security Council is to hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss the attack following calls from France and Britain. Ive seen the reports about the use of sarin and as far as I know they have not been confirmed the British ambassador to the UN Matthew Rycroft said.

Near the Turkish-Syrian border many civilians had fled their houses to avoid the battles raging in the vicinity. They sought refuge in a clump of \"clay and adobe\" homes in the nearby village of Tokhar Amnesty International said. US-led air strikes targeted the group taking out many of the women children and families who sought shelter there. This is the largest instance of civilian casualties since the US-led coalition began its bombing campaign in Syria in 2014. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a monitoring group based in the UK reported that the air strikes mistakenly identified and targeted the civilians as DAESH terrorists. The incident comes after another report of a strike killing \"a woman with four of her children and an old man\" in a separate part of the same city on Sunday the Observatory said. Recently the SDF a US-backed group mainly consisting of YPG militants associated with the PKK terrorist organisation concentrated their forces upon the strategically important city in an attempt to seize it from DAESH which took Manbij in 2014. The Syrian civil war began in mid 2011 when protests against autocrat Bashar al Assad and his regime were suppressed violently in the context of the Arab Spring uprisings. Since then the UN has estimated that nearly half of the countrys population has been forced to leave their homes and the death toll may be as high as 400000.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing. \\t \\t The attack came a few days after a senior member of Ahrar al-Sham published an op-ed piece in the Washington Post in which he denied espousing al-Qaedas ideology and portrayed his group as the moderate Islamist alternative in Syria claiming it was a key to defeating the IS. In September Ahrar al-Shams leader Hassan Abboud was killed along with several other leading members of the group in a similar bombing also in Idlib province. Ahrar al-Sham is the largest group in the Jaysh al-Fateh (Army of Conquest) the coalition of Islamist and moderate rebel groups that took control of the regime-held stronghold of Idlib in March this year. According to a report in al-Monitor the various groups in Jaysh al-Fateh are having trouble agreeing on a unified approach to governing the territory they have captured. The other large group in the coalition the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front reportedly attacked Sharia court buildings and police stations affiliated with Ahrar al-Sham-dominated Sharia authority for managing the liberated areas in Idlib in Kafr Nabl on 8 July. \\t \\tSyrian forces backed by Lebanese Hezbollah fighters have entered a rebel-held mountain resort near the border with Lebanon. This follows protests in the Idlib countryside against the Nusra Front which Nusra fighters suppressed reportedly with the use of lethal force and a bomb at a mosque last Friday in which killed at least 10 members of the group according to Reuters. UN envoy meets southern rebels UN Special Envoy for the Syria Crisis Staffan de Mistura met with leaders of the Southern Front alliance in southern Syria on Tuesday for the first time according to Reuters. The Southern Front alliance controls a significant amount of territory between the capital Damascus and the southern border and has made a number of significant gains against regime forces over the last few months. De Mistura began an extensive round of meetings with parties directly or indirectly involved in the conflict in May with an eye to ending the brutal four-year civil war. According to his office he plans to finalise plans by the end of July to reach a political solution to the conflict. Regime offensive tightens grip on Zabadani State media says Syrian forces backed by Lebanese Hizbollah fighters have entered a rebel-held mountain resort near the border with Lebanon a day after launching a major offensive to capture the town. State-run Syrian TV said troops entered the town of Zabadani from the western Jamaiyat district Sunday. Hezbollahs al-Manar TV ran exclusive footage purportedly showing Hezbollah fighters in the town. It showed scenes of heavy fighting including explosions and mushrooms of white smoke. According to other sources the regimes latest attempt to secure Zabadani started 12 days ago. \\t \\tMeshaal killed in an airstrike in Hasakeh composed several Jihadi hymns for the IS celebrating martyrdom and holy war. Regime warplanes and helicopters launched at least 60 air raids yesterday on the rebel-held Syrian town of Zabadani to the west of Damascus and a short distance from the Lebanese border according to a monitoring group. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said there had been at least 29 raids by warplanes on Zabadani and at least 34 barrel bombs dropped by helicopters so far today. The raids come as forces from the regimes army and Hezbollah are engaged in their 11th day of heavy fighting with rebel forces in the area for control of the strategic town. A spokesperson for the Zabadani Revolution Coordination Committee told al-Araby al-Jadeed on Monday that forces from the regimes army and Hezbollah had made several attempts to advance into the town from the south but all of these attempts had been repelled. Zabadanis capture would tighten Hezbollahs grip on Syrian territories bordering Lebanon and strengthen the Syrian governments control over of the Beirut-Damascus highway. The town has been held by rebels since shortly after Syrias crisis began in March 2011. US airstrikes target the IS The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported the death of two senior Islamic State group (IS) leaders in a suspected US airstrike on Monday. Abu Osama al-Iraqi and Amer al-Rafdan were killed in what is believed to have been US airstrikes in Hasakeh. A Saudi national Maher Meshaal known as Abu Hajar al-Hadrami was also killed in airstrikes in Hasakeh according to IS supporters on twitter CBS reported. Meshaal composed several Jihadi hymns for the IS celebrating martyrdom and holy war.
