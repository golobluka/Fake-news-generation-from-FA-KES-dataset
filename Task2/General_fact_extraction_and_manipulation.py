    Summary:
    This function processes a sample of articles to generate and modify facts using a specified model.
    It iteratively changes specified topics within the articles and evaluates the quality of these changes using a fake detector, to improve detector. Fake detector is used in a strict way.

    Example Usage:
    ```python
    articles = pd.DataFrame({'article_content': ["Article 1 content...", "Article 2 content..."]})
    model_name = "fact_extraction_model"
    results = extract_and_change_articles_with_labeling_added(
        articles=articles,
        general_topics=GENERAL_TOPICS,
        name_of_the_model=model_name,
        size_of_sample=2,
        type_of_generation="normal",
        change_of_article="paraphrase_abdul",
        number_of_changed_facts=3,
        print_comments=True
    )
    print(results)
    ```

    Inputs:
    - articles: List or DataFrame containing articles to process.
    - general_topics: List of dictionaries defining general topics.
    - name_of_the_model: Name of the model used for fact extraction and modification.
    - size_of_sample: Number of articles to sample from articles (default is 5).
    - type_of_generation: Method of fact generation, either "normal" or "one_by_one".
    - change_of_article: Type of article modification to apply.
    - number_of_changed_facts: Number of facts/topics to change in the article (default is 3).
    - print_comments: Boolean flag to print intermediate comments (default is False).
    - testing: Boolean flag to indicate if testing mode is active (default is False).

    Flow:
    - Randomly sample articles from the provided articles.
    - Generate facts from each sampled article using the specified model.
    - Modify the article content iteratively by changing specified topics.
    - Evaluate the quality of the modified articles using a fake detector.
    - Collect and return the results in a DataFrame.

    Outputs:
    - DataFrame containing the original and modified articles, JSON data, and topics changed.
