# Main function

def generate_fake_news(list_of_news, number_of_news, number_of_facts, number_of_facts_changed, testing=False, print_comments=False, strict=False):
  """
    Generate manipulated fake news articles by changing specific facts in the provided list of articles.

    This function samples a specified number of news articles from the input list, processes each article, and modifies a set number of facts within the article based on either pre-defined or model-generated topics. It returns the manipulated articles with labeled changes for further analysis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    list_of_news : pandas.DataFrame
        A list containing news articles or text in general.
    
    number_of_news : int
        The number of articles to sample and manipulate from the provided list of news.
    
    number_of_facts : int
        The number of facts to consider while processing each news article.
    
    number_of_facts_changed : int
        The number of facts to modify in each article to create fake news.
    
    testing : bool, optional, default=False
        If True, the function will use pre-defined testing topics for fact manipulation instead of generating them using the model.
    
    print_comments : bool, optional, default=False
        If True, intermediate steps and responses from the model will be printed for debugging or analysis purposes.
    
    strict : bool, optional, default=False
        If True, the function applies a stricter manipulation approach where facts are more aggressively changed.

    Returns
    -------
    results : pandas.DataFrame
        A DataFrame containing the manipulated articles along with the topics used for fact manipulation. The DataFrame includes both the original article and the modified version.

    Process
    -------
    1. Sample the specified number of articles from the input list.
    2. For each article, either use pre-defined topics (if testing is True) or generate topics using the "Llama3.1:8B" model.
    3. Extract and change the articles based on the generated or pre-defined topics using either a strict or non-strict method.
    4. Append the modified articles and topics to the result DataFrame.
    5. Return the final DataFrame containing all manipulated articles and their respective topics.

    Example
    -------
    >>> list_of_news = ['Article 1', 'Article 2', 'Article 3']
    >>> results = generate_fake_news(list_of_news, 2, 3, 1, testing=True, print_comments=True, strict=False)
