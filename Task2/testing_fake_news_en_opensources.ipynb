      "Original article: WARNING: The following contains minor spoilers from Disney’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may find it odd that ThinkProgress asked its religion reporter to review Disney/Lucasfilm’s new blockbuster Star Wars: The Force Awakens, directed by J.J. Abrams. To be honest, it’s largely because I’m probably the biggest Star Wars fan in the building — my desk is covered with X-Wing decals, my tea infuser is a Death Star, and I have a small Christmas tree at home festooned with Star Wars-themed ornaments (my favorite is a talking Darth Vader). And don’t even get me started on the R2-D2 Halloween costume I used to wear as a child.\n",
      "\n",
      "But experience with religion is actually a good foundation from which to assess any addition to the Star Wars universe, whose fans express such rabid devotion that “Jediism” is literally a religion in some parts of the world (usually jokingly…usually). Star Wars nuts like myself bring an intimidating level of scrutiny to any new fable in the galaxy far, far away, which makes the task set before Abrams — to satisfy devotees so zealous they effectively excommunicated Star Wars creator George Lucas when his early 2000s-era prequels didn’t meet expectations — a challenge of galactic proportions.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that in mind, I’m happy to say that the yarn Abrams spins in Awakens will delight Star Wars fans and newcomers alike — albeit with more than a few tradeoffs that won’t exactly disappoint, but that may change Star Wars forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Light: Awakens “rhymes” a lot, but in a good way, and it also sings amazing new songs\n",
      "\n",
      "Some critics have already expressed frustration with the fact that Abrams’ Awakens “rhymes,” essentially repeating story beats from the original Star Wars films. The movie does, in fact, replicate several aspects of the old trilogy, but it works amazingly well early on: The first third of Awakens wowed and delighted me in a way I haven’t felt in a theater in years — maybe since I saw the re-release of A New Hope. The characters make the audience laugh and gasp while soaring through a universe that is unmistakably Star Wars, complete with the droid beeps, lightsaber hums, and Wookie growls we’ve come to know and love. It’s a testament to both Abrams’ talent as a director and his clear adoration for Lucas’ creation; even if you’re just a causal fan of the originals, the plethora of nostalgia-ridden references will have you pumping your fist in celebration. (The rhyming game is also true to the original trilogy, which, lest we forget, intentionally repeats lines of dialogue several times and blows up the Death Star twice.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Ren is a special kind of evil, one arguably more menacing than the monster he clearly aspires to emulate — Darth Vader.\n",
      "\n",
      "This isn’t to say there’s nothing new here. Without giving too much away, the story includes several of your old favorites (Harrison Ford, Peter Mayhew, and Carrie Fischer reprise their roles as Han Solo, Chewbacca, and General Leia), but focuses primarily on two very new, deeply compelling characters who triumph in the face of impossible odds: Finn (John Boyega), an ex-Stormtrooper looking to escape his past, and the Luke Skywalker stand-in Rey (Daisy Ridley), who has trouble embracing her future. Both young actors shine in their budding roles, bringing a double-punch of much-needed diversity to the lead Star Wars cast (it even passes the Bechdel test “with flying colors”) while carving out their respective spaces as the future of the franchise. They have different strengths, but they mesh well: Boyega is hilarious as the giddy and often overeager Finn, and Ridley’s earnestness makes you want to root for Rey really, really hard. Meanwhile, Oscar Isaac’s performance as the crack Resistance pilot Poe Dameron is equal parts charming and dashing, so much so that you wish the film spent more time in his cockpit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most captivating addition to the saga, however, is Kylo Ren, a new villain portrayed admirably by Adam Driver. Ren is a special kind of evil, one arguably more menacing than the monster he clearly aspires to emulate — Darth Vader. Whereas Vader and the Emperor were expressions of a focused, concentrated darkness, Ren is something closer to raw, chaotic rage. He doesn’t respond to failure by biding his time and waiting for the right moment to strike, but instead tends to furiously swing his unstable-looking lightsaber in frustration until nearby objects are reduced to cinders. His lightsaber, by the way, is a none-too-subtle visual metaphor for his mental state: Ren is unhinged, a man whose internal struggles make him a threat to everyone around him, especially those he loves. A note to parents: This is a villain that will undoubtedly frighten children — heck, he terrified me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abrams’ work also feels different. Unlike the relatively static camerawork of the original trilogy, the new film is as kinetic as Abrams himself, bouncing rapidly from one brilliant action sequence to another, barely letting the audience breathe. It’s also literally more kinetic than any previous Star Wars film: blaster bolts throw people across rooms, explosions toss Stormtroopers like rag dolls, and the aging Millennium Falcon seems suddenly capable of taking way more punishment than it used to.\n",
      "\n",
      "In truth, the action eventually becomes a bit much, and the second half of the film crosses the line into overstimulation several times, generally valuing combat over much-needed exposition. Though a regular viewer of Abrams’ films will be used this sort of overwhelming action, original trilogy purists may find it off-putting. Still, this newfound energy is partly what makes the film’s unlikely rockstar — the spherical droid/wonderball/cuteness explosion known as BB-8 — work so well, and what will keep audiences coming back to see him and the rest of the characters bounce around spaceships in future installments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, that, and a bunch of jaw-dropping revelations that I won’t spoil for you here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dark: The film doesn’t “teach,” and lacks a central moral compass\n",
      "\n",
      "Ironically, despite the film’s aforementioned proclivity to rhyme, one of its greatest weaknesses is something it doesn’t copy from the originals. A classic hallmark of a Star Wars film is the presence of a wizened master, a moral exemplar who teaches an eager pupil valuable lessons — usually about the Force, but also about life. The original trilogy used the tag-team of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda to steer Luke Skywalker through his adventures and away from the Dark side, and Lucas’ prequel saga offered a hodgepodge of various Jedi masters to bestow wisdom on the viewer, even if the intended subject — Anakin Skywalker — ultimately failed to heed advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Awakens, by contrast, virtually abandons this concept. Rey and Finn find kinship with Han and other characters, but not tutelage. With the exception of an all-too-brief encounter with Lupita Nyong’o’s character (a fabulous computer generated figure who I will not name, but who should’ve gotten more screen time), the two newcomers are basically left to figure things out by themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "But while Han is arguably the film’s father figure, he doesn’t pretend to be a moral exemplar, and that leaves our characters — and the story — somewhat adrift.\n",
      "\n",
      "This will no doubt resonate with our “Do It Yourself” generation, fiercely independent Millennials who celebrate home-brews, iPhone jailbreaks, and even handcrafted reworkings of the original Star Wars. And the shift is expressive of characters who thirst for self-reliance: Rey, a scrap-peddling orphan, spent years surviving on her own in the desert of the planet Jakku, and Finn’s story arc sees him desperate to forge an independence long denied to him. Both characters clearly admire the swashbuckling Han, whose primary life tutor is time, experience, and trial and error.\n",
      "\n",
      "But while Han is arguably the film’s father figure, he doesn’t pretend to be a moral exemplar, and that leaves our characters — and the story — somewhat adrift. Han even seems to acknowledge the absence of a genuine mentor about midway through, when he watches Rey struggle with a blaster before saying, “You have a lot to learn” — but then offers no further instruction. Han doesn’t become Rey’s teacher in any real sense, leaving her to discern life’s secrets — not to mention details about things like the Force — entirely on her own.\n",
      "\n",
      "This rugged individualism remains true to the spirit of Han, Rey, and Finn. But it also changes the way audiences have historically interacted with Star Wars films. There is no moral compass in Awakens, no hooded figure to offer sagacity in the face of Kylo Ren’s reckless sadism. In fact, Awakens is, quite literally, a quest to find such a teacher. It’s a universe filled with characters, both young and old, who are desperate to mature, but with no one to instruct them as to how. The result is a story swelling with the power of the Force, but none of the wisdom that’s supposed to accompany it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rest: Ultimately, The Force Awakens feels more like a story than a myth — and the difference matters\n",
      "\n",
      "Much has been written about how Lucas’ original trilogy is emblematic of history’s greatest myths, particularly how it mimics the traits of archetypal heroes and religious figures outlined in scholar Joseph Campbell’s book The Hero with a Thousand Faces. George Lucas himself has acknowledged the influence ancient story models (and Campbell’s work) had on the crafting of Star Wars, and many argue that it was the series’ mythic quality — which can also be seen in beloved series such as Harry Potter and the Lord of the Rings saga — that made it so successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Awakens, however, does not emulate these mythic patterns, which some believe are what makes a tale timeless. Instead, the newest Star Wars feels a bit more like an amazing story that has little interest in being repeated for ages — even if it might be. It’s reminiscent of the now-defunct Star Wars Expanded Universe, a lexicon of stories crafted by authors, artists, and video game producers that added new tales and filled in the gaps that pockmarked Lucas’ otherwise beloved universe — but none of which succeeded in becoming myths unto themselves. Abrams toes a similar line, making his Star Wars characters more “real” by divorcing them from established — but ultimately simplistic — tropes. The movie is strengthened by it, but it will likely cost it some staying power in the long run. As Yoda would put it: a myth, this is not.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Yoda would put it: a myth, this is not.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fairness, the lack of legend in Abrams’ work is likely due to the radical shift currently rocking the film industry, where standalone films and even trilogies are being cast aside in favor of mega-moneymakers such as the Marvel franchise, with stories that are told over the course of dozens of films instead of two or three. Disney has already made it clear they intend to do the same with the Star Wars franchise, releasing one every year for as long as they can. This is a different kind of storytelling framework than Lucas’ era, and helps explain why Awakens feels like the first episode of a great series instead of standalone film.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such is the odd emotional space that Awakens ultimately occupies. Abrams’ creation is no less beautiful, no less fantastic than anything Lucas created. It’s arguably better directed than at least one of the original films (not to mention all of the prequels), and nails the universe-building challenge as well as the obligatory creation of at least one iconic character — BB-8. The acting is superb, the action sequences are Oscar-worthy, and the characters — homo sapien, robot, or otherwise — are in some ways more human than any Star Wars film to date.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this time, when the film ended and the lights went up, I didn’t want to rush home and write my own fan fiction, explore extra details in Wookieepedia (yes, that’s a thing), or imagine how Jedi wisdom mirrors the words of real-life sages. Instead — for reasons that will be made clear when you see the film — I desperately wanted to click the “next episode” button, as if on a Netflix binge, which is a dramatic departure from how the original Star Wars films made me feel. It’s a distinction between a Lucas myth and the light speed jaunt across the galaxy that Abrams has set in motion, which is less about ancient archetypes and more about creating a series of really, really amazing stories. It’s different, and I will miss Lucas’ embrace of the timeless as I watch the untold number of Star Wars movies, television shows, and virtual reality experiences to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "But rest assured, Abrams: Thanks to you, I’m going to watch every damn one of them, just as soon as I clear off a space on my desk for BB-8.\n",

      "Original article: With \"risk\" in most of the developed world seemingly a long forgotten four-letter word, as seen by today's plunge in the VIX to a level not seen since 1993, traders hoping for some \"risk event\" have been confined to the recent turmoil in China, where overnight not only did trade data disappoint, with both imports and exports missing, but bond yields jumped to the highest level since 2015, dragging stocks lower even as the local commodity crash slammed iron ore and copper to new YTD lows.\n",
      "\n",
      "While largely a \"controlled\" tightening, meant to contain China's out-of-control shadow banking system, the recent gyrations in Chinese capital markets are starting to have a profound impact on local funding, resulting in a collapse in new bond issuance, and according to FT calculations, in April the number of aborted issues rose to 154, up from 94 in March, 32 in February and 31 in January.\n",
      "\n",
      "As DB added, \"local bond markets are practically shut for corporates. In fact, YTD issuance is down 40%+ yoy and net issuance has been negative in three out of the first four months this year. A number of issuers are being forced to cancel bond issuances (over RMB100 billion YTD) and there were reports (Bloomberg) of even CDB halting issuance (though subsequently denied). Some AA corporates are now issuing at north of 7%.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "These signs of mounting stress in China’s $$9.3 trillion bond market come less than a month after the country’s banking regulator, Guo Shuqing, was quoted as supporting a campaign to sort out chaotic practices, and threatening to resign if the banking system became “a complete mess”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overnight, Deutsche Bank's China analyst Harsh Agarwal noticed the \"gyrations\" in the bond market, and compared the current selloff in onshore bonds to the similar episode one year ago, saying \"this time, it's sharper and longer - AAA yield & spreads are almost 200bp and 100bp wider respectively in the past 6 months or so - because of China's focus away from growth to deleveraging. This is far from over in our view. Every day we see headlines on new regulations trying to control leverage in different parts of the system - WMPs, insurance companies, banks, etc. Having said this, we do believe in China's ability to make a U-turn quickly if the situation goes beyond control, and see these changes as a long term positive, hence we are not overly worried as of now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe not as of now, but Agarwal is surely getting more concerned with every incremental negative news out of China, even as the PBOC refuses to inject more liquidity, as it just did moments ago when for the third day in a row, the central bank skipped open market operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, confirming that Beijing is clearly concerned about developments behind the scene, potentially culminating in the worst possible case for China's banking system - a shadow bank run -China Banking Regulatory Commission said in guidelines on banks’ collateral management posted on its website.\n",
      "\n",
      "Commercial banks should carry out pressure tests on collaterals at least once a year, China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) posted new guidelines on banks’ collateral management, among which that banks should revalue collateral at least once a year; and that banks are being urged to prevent risks in the collateral business. Of course, since this is the country where due to \"infinite rehypothecation\" of collateral, thousands of tons of copper and aluminum were \"found\" to be missing at China's Qingdao Port, urging Chinese banks to engage in collateral \"quality control\" seems like a lost cause.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, the banking regulator itself appears to be in on the joke, because as Bloomberg's Tom Orlik points out, the CBRC requires that collateral accepted by banks must actually exist, as explicitly stated in Chapter 3 on \"Risk Mangement\" in the just released Collateral Guidelines:\n",
      "\n",
      "Article 15 The collateral received by a commercial bank shall meet the following basic conditions: the collateral is real;\n",
      "\n",
      "the relationship between the collateral is clear, the mortgage (pledged) has the right to dispose of the collateral;\n",
      "\n",
      "the collateral conforms to the laws and regulations or the national policy requirements;\n",
      "\n",
      "the collateral has a good ability to achieve liquidity.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's not all.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a subsequent notice posted in the Securities Times, the Chinese outlet reports that some Chinese rural banks have suspended their interbank businesses including negotiable certificates of deposit (or NCDs) \"temporarily\" while regulators conduct spot checks. It further adds that at the end of March total interbank liabilities of 25 banks listed in China’s stock market dropped by 1.54t yuan from end-2016, report says, citing Wind Info data, suggesting a sharp contraction in shadow funding.\n",
      "\n",
      "While it was not immediately clear what the underlying catalyst for the unexpected move was, recall that at the end of March, Deutsche Bank reported that in the most recent troubling trend involving Chinese banks, numerous smaller banks had become acutely reliant on such shadow banking funding mechanism as Certificates of Deposit, which had become the primary source of short-term funding for many of China's banks mid-size and smaller banks.\n",
      "\n",
      "As DB further explained, the banks most exposed to a shut down in this \"shadow funding\" pathway are medium-sized and small banks, for whome as of 1H16, wholesale funding made up 31% and 23%, a number that has risen substantially in the interim period.\n",
      "\n",
      "As Deutsche reflected just over a month ago, \"we view banks that are more reliant on CDs as more vulnerable to rising rates and tighter regulations.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Reflecting tighter liquidity, the interbank CD rate has rallied\n",
      "\n",
      "strongly, with the 6-month CD pricing at 4.6% on average. Some CDs\n",
      "\n",
      "issued by smaller rural commercial banks have been priced close to 5%\n",
      "\n",
      "recently. This would have pushed up the funding cost and notably for\n",
      "\n",
      "smaller banks. If banks invest in low-risk assets such as mortgages,\n",
      "\n",
      "discounted bills and treasury bonds, this would lead to a negative\n",
      "\n",
      "spread. Alternatively, banks can lengthen asset duration, increase the\n",
      "\n",
      "risk appetite, add leverage or slow down asset growth. Among these\n",
      "\n",
      "alternatives, we believe a slowdown in asset growth is the most likely.\n",
      "\n",
      "And while it is tangential, here is a list of the banks most exposed to a sudden cardiac arrest involving CDs: INDB, SPDB and PAB are among the most exposed to interbank CDs.\n",
      "\n",
      "We would not be surprised if these are among the banks that as of this evening have \"suspended their interbank businesses.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Which again brings us to the most important question: \"Are we close to a “tipping point” in China?\" For those who missed the answer the first time, here is Deutsche Bank's conclusion as of mid-March. Note: since then the liquidity situation in China has gotten far more precarious. Here's Deutsche:\n",
      "\n",
      "For now, probably not, especially in a year of leadership transition. In our view, the risk of an uncontrollable liquidity event is low, as the PBOC will do whatever it takes to inject liquidity if needed. In the domestic liquidity market, the PBOC exerts strong influence in both the volume and pricing of liquidity. With 90%+ of financial institutions directly or indirectly controlled by the government, PBOC will likely continue to give liquidity support. In 2H15, the central bank established an interest rate corridor to contain interbank rates within a narrow range and pledged to inject unlimited liquidity to support banks with funding needs. However, continuing liquidity injections do not come without a cost. A bigger asset bubble, persistent capital outflow pressure and a lower yield curve over the longer term are side effects that China will have to bear. At the same time, the execution risk of PBOC itself is rising.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, whether or not China keels over and has a hard (or worse) landing, will depend on the PBOC; when (not if) the central bank gets involved, will depend on how soon China's banks and various CD-funded financial institutions run out of collateral (whether it exists or not) to sell, such as iron ore, copper, precious metals, bonds and even stocks. This will hardly come as a surprise. As we showed last month, the only reason the Chinese banking system hasn't imploded, is due to nearly CNY 10 trillion in central bank liquidity support for the local banks.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing, however, is certain: with western central banks refusing to let the market clear on its own, or deflate the $$14 trillion liquidity bubble which has suppressed price formation for the past 8 years, the PBOC is merely doing what all of its \"civilized\" peers have been doing for years - kicking the can, and praying.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until then, however, things may be about to get a whole lot worse for China's capital and commodity markets.\n"
