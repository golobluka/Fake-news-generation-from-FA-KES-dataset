      "Original article:  Thu Jul 7 2016 Hezbollah Syrian Army Kill 2 Al-Nusra Front Commanders in Qalamoun The Syrian army backed by Hezbollah resistance fighters has thwarted an attack by terrorists in Syrias Qalamoun region killing two commanders of the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front terrorist group. Informed sources said the terrorist commanders were killed on Thursday during fierce fighting which broke out in Qalamoun located on Damascus countryside Lebanons al-Manar TV channel reported. In a post on its Twitter account Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah identified one of those slain as Abu Obaida adding that the militant was killed in Syrias southwestern town of Serghaya. In another development on Thursday Syrian troops and Hezbollah fighters managed to completely wrest control over the Mallah farms near the northwestern city of Aleppo. They further recaptured the Castello road which was used by terrorists as a strategic path to the eastern neighborhoods of Aleppo. Meanwhile SANA news agency reported that the Syrian army managed to foil an attack by the Takfiri ISIS terrorists on a number of military posts in the eastern province of Deir Ezzor. Syria has been gripped by foreign-backed militancy since March 2011. Lebanon is also suffering from the spillover of militancy in neighboring Syria. Hezbollah fighters have been assisting Syrian army forces in fending off several terrorist attacks. Hezbollah and the Syrian military began a joint offensive on the Lebanon-Syria border last year to dislodge the ISIS and Nusra Front militants from the area. The Lebanese army also strikes the extremists hideouts on a nearly daily basis. SSH 11\n",

      "Original article:  Monday 21 November 2016 19:18 Over 500 Civilians Killed in One Week in Ongoing Bombing Campaign Majority of Them in Aleppo. At least 545 people including 84 children and 35 women have been killed and hundreds more injured in the escalating bombing campaign by the Assad regime and Russian air forces on Syrias towns and cities since Tuesday. According to figures compiled by the Syrian Coalitions media office Aleppo bore the brunt of the ferocious airstrikes and artillery bombardment with 374 people recorded killed in the city and countryside during the past week. The Russian and Assad regime forces on Tuesday resumed aerial and artillery bombardment on rebel-held areas across Syria following a brief pause targeting mainly civilian areas and vital civilian infrastructure in Aleppo Idlib Homs and eastern Ghouta. The directorate of health in Aleppo province on Saturday announced the suspension of work in all hospitals in the citys besieged neighborhoods after being directly hit by airstrikes. The directorate said in a statement that it was no longer able to offer medical care to around 300 000 civilians trapped in the eastern parts of the city. Activists said that 67 people were killed and dozens more injured in airstrikes on Aleppo and its countryside on Sunday adding that the airstrikes were concentrated on the neighborhoods of Sakhour Shaar Jabal Badro Ard Alhamra Seif Addawla and Karm Aljabal in the besieged eastern parts of the city. Two more civilians were killed in a rocket attack by regime forces on the town of Bayanoun north of Aleppo. Civil defense corps announced that two of its centers in the neighborhood of Hanano and the town of Orim Alqubra in rural Aleppo were put out of service after being hit by the Russian and Assad regime warplanes on Sunday. Doctors Without Borders (MSF) on Saturday said that the only specialized pediatric hospital in besieged eastern Aleppo has come under attack for the second time since airstrikes resumed on 15 November. It pointed out that at least 130 medical facilities have been targeted by airstrikes and barrel bombs since the beginning of 2016. Meanwhile the directorate of education in Idlib province on Monday announced the closure of all schools in the province until the end of the week due to the relentless bombing campaign. Activists in rural Idlib said that five people were killed and dozens more injured in multiple Russian airstrikes on the town of Idlib on Sunday. In rural Homs meanwhile activists said that a UN aid convoy was not able to enter the town of Rastan due to artillery shelling by regime forces on Sunday. Regime forces also pounded the towns of Ghanto Talbeesah Alsien and Zafarana with heavy artillery causing many civilian casualties. (Source: Syrian Coalitions Media Office) Twitter\n",

Vice-president of the Syrian Coalition Abdul Ahad Steifo said that the ongoing brutal assault on Aleppo by the Assad regime Russia and the Iranian militias has so far failed to achieve its objectives to retake the entire city in spite of the genocidal crimes being committed against civilians. Aleppo has seen the gravest war crimes since World War II Steifo said adding that the regime Russia and Iran have not achieved their objectives in Aleppo. Russia is now seeking to get of the trouble it brought upon itself in Syria. Aleppo and its countryside have been subjected to ferocious onslaught by the Assad regime and Russian forces since November 15. Over 750 people mostly women and children have so far been killed and thousands more injured in the ongoing bombing campaign on the city and its countryside. Steifo stressed the urgent need for the resumption of the political process through negotiations in Geneva and the enforcement of UN resolutions especially the humanitarian provisions that call for an end to the bombing lifting the sieges the delivery of aid to civilians in need and the release of detainees.

      "Original article:  Date of publication 12 August 2016 Airstrikes in opposition areas of Syrias northern Aleppo province struck a market a hospital and a village on Friday. Tags Aleppo civil defence UN airstrikes Russia Airstrikes in opposition areas of Syrias northern Aleppo province struck a market a hospital and a village on Friday killing at least 18 people including children and two hospital staffers. The air raids hit the only hospital for women and children in the town of Kafr Hamra before dawn killing two staffers including a nurse. The Syrian Civil Defence a group of first responders said it pulled 10 people alive from under the rubble. Kafr Hamra is near the northern front line in the deeply divided city of Aleppo where government troops have sealed the main route into opposition areas effectively trapping nearly 300000 residents. The Syrian Civil Defence said one of its centres in the rebel-held part of Aleppo was hit. Pictures on the groups Facebook page showed serious damage to one of its vehicles and crumbling walls. The volunteer group said one of its most well-known members died after being buried under the rubble following a Wednesday airstrike in the Ramouseh area recently seized by rebels from government forces. Khaled Harah had recovered a live baby from a destroyed building in Aleppos Sukkari neighbourhood in 2014 following a 16-hour rescue effort. \"It was a miracle\" said Bibars Mishal a colleague of Harah in Aleppo. Harah was later invited to the UN Security Council to testify about the violence in Aleppo. Mishal said Harahs body was pulled from the rubble on Thursday. Read more here Syrian miracle baby saver killed in Aleppo The opposition fighters launched a counteroffensive last week breaching the siege from the south. That road remains under fire and the UN has asked for a cease-fire to allow aid into the area. Health facilities have been frequently targeted in the civil war in Syria. Aid groups have said the month of July was one of the worst since the war began in 2011 with some 43 facilities in opposition areas partially or totally destroyed. Despite calls for a ceasefire and Russias promise of a three-hour daily respite from airstrikes to allow in humanitarian aid there has been no let-up in the violence. During the day Friday airstrikes hit a market in the nearby town of Urem al-Kubra killing at least six people according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which relies on activists on the ground. Urem al-Kubra lies on the road linking Aleppo to the northern rebel-controlled province of Idlib which has also seen intense bombing. In the northern Aleppo countryside at least 10 people were killed including children and women when airstrikes hit the village of Hayan. It was not clear what the target was but videos shared by activists of the scene of the attack show the bodies of women and children strewn on the side of the road as frantic residents scramble to recover them. The Local Coordination Committees an activist collective said outdoor Friday prayers were called off in Idlib because of the intensity of the airstrikes. Germany meanwhile called for UN-supervised humanitarian access to Aleppo saying Russias unilateral three-hour daily cease-fire isnt enough. Russia has been carrying out airstrikes to bolster Syrian government forces since last September. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was quoted as telling Fridays edition of the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that \"humanitarian access cant be under the single-handed control of one side of the conflict.\" \"A unilaterally declared three-hour cease-fire per day isnt enough to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe\" he said.

Despite calls for a ceasefire and Russia's promise of a three-hour daily respite from airstrikes to allow in humanitarian aid, there has been no let-up in the violence. During the day Friday airstrikes hit a market in the nearby town of Urem al-Kubra killing at least six people according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which relies on activists on the ground. Urem al-Kubra lies on the road linking Aleppo to the northern rebel-controlled province of Idlib which has also seen intense bombing. In the northern Aleppo countryside at least 10 people were killed including children and women when airstrikes hit the village of Hayan. It was not clear what the target was but videos shared by activists of the scene of the attack show the bodies of women and children strewn on the side of the road as frantic residents scramble to recover them. The Local Coordination Committees, an activist collective, said outdoor Friday prayers were called off in Idlib because of the intensity of the airstrikes. Germany meanwhile called for UN-supervised humanitarian access to Aleppo saying Russia's unilateral three-hour daily ceasefire isn't enough. Russia has been carrying out airstrikes to bolster Syrian government forces since last September. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was quoted as telling Friday's edition of the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that \"humanitarian access can't be under the single-handed control of one side of the conflict.\" \"A unilaterally declared three-hour ceasefire per day isn't enough to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe\" he said.

      "Original article:  Sun Feb 21 2016 Twin Bomb Attacks Kill 50 Injure Dozens in Syrias Homs Province. At least 50 people have lost their lives and 100 others sustained injuries in twin bomb attacks targeting a residential neighborhood in Syrias western city of Homs. Security officials speaking on condition of anonymity said two vehicles laden with explosives went off within less than a minute of each other at a traffic light at al-Siteen Street in al-Zahraa district of the city located 162 kilometers (101 miles) north of the capital Damascus on Sunday morning. A report by the so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the toll could rise further because of the high number of people seriously wounded in the attacks. No group has claimed responsibility for the act of violence so far but such terrorist attacks are usually carried out by the Takfiri militant groups active in the area. In a similar incident last December more than 30 people were killed and 90 others wounded in two bomb explosions that rocked al-Zahraa neighborhood of Homs. The December attack came after foreign-backed militants began evacuating the last district they were controlling in the city under a deal with Damascus. The new fatal bombings come in the wake of significant army gains against Takfiri terror groups on several fronts particularly the northwestern province of Aleppo near the Turkish border. The foreign-sponsored conflict in Syria which flared in March 2011 has claimed the lives of some 470000 people and left 1.9 million injured according to the Syrian Center for Policy Research. Moreover 6.36 million people have been displaced internally and more than four million others have fled the country since the beginning of the conflict. That accounts for 45 percent of the countrys population which has shrunk by 21 percent. Syria accuses Saudi Arabia Turkey and Qatar of funding and arming terrorist groups operating inside the country including Daesh; Press TV reported. SSH 11\n",

However, it mentions \"No group has claimed responsibility for the act of violence so far but such terrorist attacks are usually carried out by government forces in a bid to crush opposition and terrorize civilians.\" Later on, it also states that \"Syria accuses Saudi Arabia Turkey and Qatar of funding and arming terrorist groups operating inside the country including Daesh;\" which implies that Takfiri militant groups (Daesh) are one of the terrorist groups operating inside Syria. Therefore, based on this implication, it can be inferred that the actor in question is indeed a Takfiri militant group like Daesh.\n",

      "Sun Feb 21 2016 Twin Bomb Attacks Kill 50 Injure Dozens in Syria's Aleppo Province. At least 50 people have lost their lives and 100 others sustained injuries in twin bomb attacks targeting a residential neighborhood in Syria's northern city of Aleppo. Security officials speaking on condition of anonymity said two vehicles laden with explosives went off within less than a minute of each other at a traffic light at al-Shuhadaa Street in al-Muwasalat district of the city located 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of the capital Damascus on Sunday morning. A report by the so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the toll could rise further because of the high number of people seriously wounded in the attacks. No group has claimed responsibility for the act of violence so far but such terrorist attacks are usually carried out by government forces in a bid to crush opposition and terrorize civilians. In a similar incident last December more than 30 people were killed and 90 others wounded in two bomb explosions that rocked al-Muwasalat neighborhood of Aleppo. The December attack came after foreign-backed militants began evacuating the last district they were controlling in the city under a deal with Damascus. The new fatal bombings come in the wake of significant army gains against terrorist groups on several fronts particularly the northwestern province of Idlib near the Turkish border. The foreign-sponsored conflict in Syria which flared in March 2011 has claimed the lives of some 470000 people and left 1.9 million injured according to the Syrian Center for Policy Research. Moreover, 6.36 million people have been displaced internally and more than four million others have fled the country since the beginning of the conflict. That accounts for 45 percent of the country's population which has shrunk by 21 percent. Syria accuses Saudi Arabia Turkey and Qatar of funding and arming terrorist groups operating inside the country including Daesh; Press TV reported. SSH 11\n",
