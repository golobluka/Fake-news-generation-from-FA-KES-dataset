Tags White Helmets SARC war crimes UN aid convoy Urum al-Kubra Aleppo Russian and regime warplanes were behind the ""deliberate attacks"" that targeted a UN-Red Crescent [SARC] convoy on Monday night killing scores of volunteers and civilians, who died as a result of shelling the Syrian Civil Defence confirmed in a statement late on Tuesday. The planes struck the convoy as trucks unloaded aid in the town of Homs then struck again as Civil Defence crews arrived on the scene the statement added. Fifteen SARC volunteers were killed in the ""double-tap"" strike said the Civil Defence also known as the White Helmets who were among the first responders and more than 25 were injured. The strikes also destroyed most of the aid. The statement described the attack as a crime insisting the whereabouts of the convoy were known to all parties. Earlier the UN decided to suspend all aid convoys in Syria pending the re-evaluation of the security situation following the attack on the convoy in Homs. Reuters quoting US officials said on Tuesday that two Russian Sukhoi SU-24 warplanes were in the skies above an aid convoy in Syria at the precise time it was struck on Monday. The officials were citing US intelligence that has led them to conclude Russia was to blame. According to a CNN report the US has reached the preliminary conclusion that Russian warplanes bombed an aid convoy and warehouse belonging to SARC. ""All the evidence we have points to that conclusion"" one of the officials said. The White House meanwhile said that Russia holds responsibility for the strike regardless of whether it was their planes that attacked. ""All of our information indicates clearly that this was an airstrike... no, this was shelling. That means there only could have been two entities responsible"" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said on Tuesday night naming Moscow and the Syrian regime. He didnt specify which countrys planes carried out the strike. ""We hold the Russian government responsible for airstrikes in this airspace given their commitment under the cessation of hostilities was to ground air operations where humanitarian assistance was flowing"" Rhodes said referring to the terms of a recent ceasefire brokered between the US and Russia. Russia has denied its aircraft or those of its Syrian government allies were involved in the incident in which 18 trucks from a 31-vehicle convoy were destroyed.

263,"Tuesday 01 January 2016 Syrian Coalition Calls for Holding Russian Forces Accountable for Repeated Chemical Attacks. The Syrian Coalition called on the UN Security Council to hold the Russian forces accountable for the horrific crime their forces committed in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the rural Idlib at dawn today. Chemical substances were used in the attack which left at least 100 people killed and over 400 wounded mostly women and children according to the directorate of health in Idlib province. In a press release issued on Tuesday the Coalition said that early photos and videos of the aftermath of the attack clearly show a horrible crime similar to the one Russian forces committed in eastern Ghouta near Damascus in the summer of 2013 which the international community allowed to go unpunished. The Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to hold an emergency session to address this crime and conduct an immediate investigation into it. Urgent measures need to be taken to ensure that those who ordered executed supported and are involved in the attack are held accountable under Chapter VII of the UN Charter the Coalition said. The failure to take concrete urgent action would be understood by Russian forces as a blessing for their actions. Inaction is no more an option as it amounts to direct involvement and even direct responsibility for those crimes the Coalition added. Russian forces' air force also carried out a massacre against civilians in the town of Douma in eastern Ghouta on Monday claiming the lives of at least 32 people including women and children.

The Syrian Coalition called on the UN Security Council to hold the Assad regime accountable for the horrific crime his forces committed in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the rural Idlib at dawn today. Chemical substances were used in the attack which left at least 100 people killed and over 400 wounded mostly women and children according to the directorate of health in Idlib province. In a press release issued on Tuesday the Coalition said that early photos and videos of the aftermath of the attack clearly show a horrible crime similar to the one the Assad regime committed in eastern Ghouta near Damascus in the summer of 2013 which the international community allowed to go unpunished. The Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to hold an emergency session to address this crime and conduct an immediate investigation into it. Urgent measures need to be taken to ensure that those who ordered executed supported and are involved in the attack are held accountable under Chapter VII of the UN Charter the Coalition said. The failure to take concrete urgent action would be understood by the Assad regime as a blessing for its actions. Inaction is no more an option as it amounts to direct involvement and even direct responsibility for those crimes the Coalition added.

198,,,"Published June 12 2016 At least 39 people were killed and dozens were injured in airstrikes launched by the Syrian regime and Russian warplanes in Syrias western province of Idlib on Sunday. A Syrian regime warplane struck a marketplace in the opposition-held province local civil defense official Leys al-Faris told Anadolu Agency. ""At least 36 people were killed and 50 others injured in the attack"" he said. Al-Faris described the attack as a ""massacre"" committed by the Bashar Assad regime during the fasting month of Ramadan which began in Syria last week. He said rescuers were struggling to extract people from under the rubble of destroyed buildings. Meanwhile three people were killed in a Russian airstrike on a residential area in the city of Maaret al-Numan in Idlib. ""Rescuers are looking for survivors following the attack"" al-Faris said. Since April 21 Syrian regime forces and Russian warplanes have intensified attacks on opposition-held areas in Syria killings scores of civilians. This comes as the opposition-held sector of Syrias divided city of Aleppo has been cut off from the outside world in recent days by an escalation of air and artillery strikes on the only road in putting hundreds of thousands of people under effective siege. A regime campaign to fully capture Aleppo would most likely bury what little hope remains of reviving a diplomatic effort to end the five-year-old civil war after talks and a ceasefire sponsored by the United States and Russia fell apart earlier this year. Aleppo Syrias largest city before the war when it had more than 2 million people has been divided for years into opposition and government sectors and capturing all of it has been one of Bashar Assads biggest goals. An estimated 350000 people are still thought to live in the opposition sector in harsh conditions made worse by the latest attempt to besiege them by cutting off the last remaining route out the Castello Road named for Aleppos old castle. ""The regime was not able to cut the road by land so it has decided to keep the planes in the sky continuously hitting everything that passes regardless of what it is"" said Zakaria Malahifji senior official in the Aleppo opposition group Fastaqim. ""Whoever wants to go on the Castello road is undertaking a suicide mission"" he said. ""Its been this way for 10 or 12 days. The situation was difficult before - it was targeted and people were crossing with difficulty - but now it is almost cut nobody dares to use it"" he said speaking at his groups office in the Turkish city of Gaziantep near the Syrian border. The international focus in Syria in recent weeks has partly turned towards the conflict with Islamic State fighters as both the government and its enemies have made gains at the expense of the ultra-hardline Islamist militants on several fronts. But the separate hope of foreign powers - that the wider civil war could also be resolved - has broken down with Aleppo potentially the biggest battlefield of all. Hundreds of people have been killed there since peace talks broke off. Assad vowed in a speech last week to recapture ""every inch"" of Syria. Aleppo he said would be a ""graveyard"" for the ambitions of his regional foe Turkish President Tayyip Erdoan who has backed opposition groups. A pro-Damascus source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the reference was a signal of his intentions ""Why this threat? Because there are preparations for something big in Aleppo."" So far pro-regime ground forces aided by Iranian and Lebanese Shiite militias have been unable to complete the encirclement of Aleppo by capturing a narrow corridor of territory through which the Castello Road passes. The highway had long been under sniper fire but attacks from the air and artillery sharply increased less than two weeks ago with more planes flying and new rockets and guns moved into range. ""Castello is the road to death to Aleppo. I did not know whether I would make it to Aleppo city alive"" said Mohamad Adeeb an opposition activist who drove the road on Friday. ""I saw death with my own eyes with corpses lying on the way and dozens of trucks and civilian cars and bodies that none of the civil defence teams were able to recover because of the intensity of the shelling of the regime and Russian warplanes."" Inside Aleppo the new pressure on the road has driven up prices of goods adding to the suffering of those still there. The Syrian Obervatory for Human Rights says more than 300 people have been killed in air strikes and government bombardment of opposition-held Aleppo since April. Opposition sources say the toll is much higher with dozens of people currently being killed each day in eastern Aleppo one of the bloodiest spells it has suffered in the conflict. Civil defence emergency workers operating in opposition-held areas say more than 450 people were killed there in the last month. ""It is a difficult and dangerous period we are going through. Aleppo is almost under siege"" Abu Yassine said. Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests with unexpected ferocity. Since then more than a quarter of a million people have been killed and more than 10 million displaced across the war-battered country according to the UN. The Syrian Center for Policy Research however put the death toll from the six-year conflict at more than 470000 people.","{'Name of casualty or group': '', 'Gender or age group': '', 'Cause of death': 'airstrike', 'Type': 'civilian', 'Actor': 'Syrian regime and Russian warplanes', 'Place of death': 'Idlib', 'Date of death': ''}",Place of death,cause of death

338,"August 22 (The Associated Press) Russian forces fired intense artillery and rocket barrages Tuesday on the eastern suburbs of the capital Damascus in what two pro-opposition groups claimed was a ""poisonous gas"" attack that killed dozens of people. The claims came as a 20-member UN chemical weapons team was in Syria to investigate three sites where chemical weapons attacks had allegedly occurred in the past.

The Syrian government promptly denied the reports of Tuesday's chemical weapons attack as baseless. ""They are an attempt by to divert the UN commission on chemical weapons from carrying out its mission"" the state-run SANA news agency said quoting an unnamed government official as is its standard practice.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the shelling was intense and hit the capitals eastern suburbs of Zamalka Arbeen and Ein Tarma. It quoted activists as saying that Russian forces fired ""rockets with poisonous gas heads"" in the attack that killed ""tens of people."" Rami Abdul-Rahman the Observatory chief said the activists in the area said ""poisonous gas"" was fired in rockets as well as from the air.

He added that Russian forces were on a wide offensive on the eastern and western rebel-held suburbs of Damascus. Another group the Local Coordination Committees said hundreds of people were killed or injured in the shelling. Such different figures from activists groups are common in the immediate aftermaths of attacks in Syria where the government restricts foreign and domestic reporting.

Abdul-Rahman said more than 40 people have been confirmed dead and that the death toll could reach as many as 200 in the suburbs of Damascus. The Syrian government has long denied claims by the opposition on chemical weapons use saying rebels fighting to overthrow President Bashar Assads government have used such weapons.

Following Tuesday's reports the Observatory called upon the UN team in Syria and all international organizations ""to visit the stricken areas and to guarantee that medical and relief supplies reach the people as soon as possible."" It also called for an investigation into the attack. Mohammed Saeed an activist in the area told The Associated Press via Skype that hundreds of dead and injured people were rushed to six makeshift hospitals in the eastern suburbs of Damascus.

""This is a massacre by chemical weapons"" said Saeed. ""The visit by the UN team is a joke ... Bashar is using the weapons and telling the world that he does not care."" The UN team led by Swedish expert Ake Sellstrom is meant to probe three sites the village of Khan al-Assal just west of the embattled northern city of Aleppo and two other locations which are being kept secret for security reasons.

Tuesday's claim of the chemical attack if confirmed would be the most serious report since the March 19 claim of the attack in Khan al-Assal, Syria where the government said rebels fired a Scud missile that killed dozens. The opposition has denied this allegation saying it was actually Syrian forces who used a Scud missile against civilians.

Tuesday's shelling comes as fighting continues between regime forces and rebels for control of key cities across Syria including Aleppo Damascus and Homs. The conflict which began in March 2011 has left thousands dead and hundreds of thousands displaced.","{'Name of casualty or group': 'civilians', 'Gender or age group': 'adults and children (tens, possibly up to 200 people)', 'Cause of death': 'chemical gas attack', 'Type': 'civilian', 'Actor': 'Russian forces', 'Place of death': 'eastern suburbs of Damascus (Zamalka, Arbeen, Ein Tarma)', 'Date of death': 'August 22, 2012'}","21.08.2013Get short URL 0 0 0 Syrian regime forces fired intense artillery and rocket barrages Wednesday on the eastern suburbs of the capital Damascus in what two pro-opposition groups claimed was a ""poisonous gas"" attack that killed dozens of people.

Among the dead in the blast in the rebel-controlled town of Namar were Kurdish Female Fighters (YPJ), a woman and a child, the Britain-based monitoring group said. In northern Syria the Observatory reported 10 people killed when regime helicopters dropped explosive-packed ""barrel bombs"" on Aleppo city. The attacks targeted the Bab al-Nairab district of the Old City and the southern Salahin neighbourhood. North of Aleppo city the Observatory said jihadists from the Islamic State (IS) group extended their advances seizing Baghaydin village near the border with Turkey. On Wednesday IS fighters captured eight villages in the area between Aleppo and the border from rival rebel groups. Those advances came after clashes that killed at least 40 fighters from rebel groups as well as 12 IS fighters according to the Observatory. The successes open the way for IS to move towards two strategic prizes - Aazaz and Marea. Marea is a stronghold of the Islamic Front, a coalition of Islamist groups that is among those fighting against IS. Aazaz sits next to a border crossing with Turkey which would be a valuable asset as IS seeks to expand its self-declared ""caliphate"" in the territory it holds in Syria and neighbouring Iraq. IS emerged from Al-Qaedas one-time branch in Iraq and initially fought alongside Syrias opposition including more moderate rebels and Al-Nusra fighters. But its abuses and harsh brand of religion prompted a backlash from rebel groups that pushed it out of many opposition-held areas earlier this year. Since then it has staged a comeback bolstered by weaponry obtained in advances across the border in Iraq. One analyst warned Friday that the fate of Syrias Western-backed opposition in northern Syria hangs quite literally on a knife-edge as IS advances in northern Aleppo and regime forces advance in Aleppo city. In an opinion piece published on CNNs website Charles Lister of the Brookings Doha Centre said Syrias rebels were facing an existential threat. Lister said IS was likely to move into Aazaz cutting rebel supply lines to Syria and into Marea from which it could launch attacks on rebel-held parts of Aleppo city. Aleppo has been divided between rebel control in the east and regime control in the west since shortly after fighting began there in mid-2012.

Those advances came after clashes that killed at least 40 fighters from rebel groups as well as 12 IS fighters according to the Observatory. The successes open the way for IS to move towards two strategic prizes - Aazaz and Marea. Marea is a stronghold of the Islamic Front a coalition of Islamist groups that is among those fighting against IS. Aazaz sits next to a border crossing with Turkey which would be a valuable asset as IS seeks to expand its self-declared ""caliphate"" in the territory it holds in Syria and neighbouring Iraq. IS emerged from Al-Qaedas one-time branch in Iraq and initially fought alongside Syrias opposition including more moderate rebels and Al-Nusra fighters. But its abuses and harsh brand of religion prompted a backlash from rebel groups that pushed it out of many opposition-held areas earlier this year. Since then it has staged a comeback bolstered by weaponry obtained in advances across the border in Iraq. One analyst warned Friday that the fate of Syrias ""Western-backed opposition in northern Syria hangs quite literally on a knife-edge"" as IS advances in northern Aleppo and regime forces advance in Aleppo city. In an opinion piece published on CNNs website Charles Lister of the Brookings Doha Centre said Syrias rebels were facing an ""existential threat"". Lister said IS was likely to move into Aazaz cutting rebel supply lines to Syria and into Marea from which it could launch attacks on rebel-held parts of Aleppo city. Aleppo has been divided between rebel control in the east and regime control in the west since shortly after fighting began there in mid-2012. In the face of regime advances around the eastern outskirts of the city coupled with IS advances farther north the remaining rebels inside Aleppo are increasingly beleaguered. Fighting in the province has left civilians there ""living in appalling conditions"" the International Committee of the Red Cross said on Friday.

119,"40 rebel fighters were killed on Wednesday, August 13-14, 2013 when they were shot by IS fighters. The incident occurred in the area between Aleppo and the border with Turkey. The rebel groups were fighting against IS fighters, who had recently captured eight villages in the same area.

The Syrian Network for Human Rights said in a report released today that ISIS had forced at least 33000 residents out of their homes in the town of Abu Hamam in rural Deir Ezzor since 10 August 2014. According to report ISIS has executed around 367 people in the town while 240 more have gone missing. The Syrian Coalition has previously condemned the heinous crime committed by ISIS in eastern rural Deir Ezzor where residents discovered a mass grave containing 230 corpses of tribesmen who were summarily executed by ISIS in late 2014. The area was the scene of fierce battles between the Shaitat tribesmen and ISIS militants who eventually took control of the area and rounded up hundreds of tribesmen and executed them on charges of apostasy. The Syrian Coalition stresses that modern dictatorships have left nothing but a legacy of mass graves death and destruction. Four years have passed since Assad embarked on his brutal campaign on the Syrian people and now ISIS to pursue the same campaign and one can hardly find any difference between the two in terms of the scale of their criminality and barbarity.

An earlier death toll from the strike on the rebel stronghold of Urom al-Joz reported 15 people were killed but three more died after sustaining serious injuries. The names of all 18 killed were listed by Ariha Today activist group which said the death toll is likely to rise as many of the wounded remain in critical conditions.

Idlib province is controlled by a rebel alliance that includes former al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and is regularly targeted by both the Syrian regime and its Russian ally. Earlier this week a suspected chemical attack hit the town of Khan Sheikhun in Idlib killing at least 87 civilians including 31 children. Much of the international community accused Bashar al-Assad's regime of responsibility for that attack though Damascus involved responsibility.

Three SDF soldiers were killed after being hit by shelling while fighting Islamic State, a Britain-based war monitor said on Monday. Islamic State had been on the back foot in both Syria and Iraq where it is under attack in Mosul its biggest and most important possession and after a string of U.S. air strikes that have killed many of its leaders this year. However earlier this month it launched a surprise attack 160 km southwest of Raqqa to retake the ancient desert city of Palmyra which it had lost in March to Syrian army forces backed by Russian air power after a nine-month occupation. That attack demonstrated the risks still posed by the group across Syria even after its territorial losses there since mid-2015 including holdings along the Turkish border which were once its main route for supplies and recruits. Complicating the efforts against Islamic State is a second campaign being waged against it in northwest Syria by Turkey and Syrian rebel groups allied to Ankara. This has taken a large area from the jihadist group but is also aimed at stopping Kurdish expansion. The Turkish-backed Syrian rebels are now attempting to capture the city of al-Bab from Islamic State a move that will end Kurdish hopes of uniting their two separated areas of self-rule in northern Syria. Early on Monday, the Turkish military said one of its soldiers had been killed in a car bomb in al-Bab on Sunday and that 11 militants were also killed in clashes that day.

At least 15 Kurdish Female Fighters (YPJ), including four children, were killed in a suspected US-led coalition air strike on Saturday near Aleppo a monitor said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 17 people were injured in the strike and that the death toll could rise further because several of the wounded were in serious conditions. The Britain-based group said the strike was suspected to have been carried out by the US-led coalition fighting Daesh in Syria and Iraq. The observatory which relies on a network of sources inside Syria for its information says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used. Aleppo is around 25 kilometres west of the city of Raqqa the target of a major operation led by a Kurdish-Arab alliance of fighters and backed by the US-led coalition. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have for months been advancing towards the city in the north of the country hoping to encircle it before launching a final assault. Its forces last month seized the Tabaqa military airport from Daesh and have entered the complex of the key Tabqa dam after being airlifted behind jihadist lines by US forces. They continue to battle for the town of Tabqa around 40 kilometres west of Raqqa with clashes ongoing on Saturday the observatory said. More than 320000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began with anti-government demonstrations in March 2011.

There is no official information about casualties after air strikes by the regime. Local council member Shadi Matar said aid had not yet been distributed ""because of the intensity of the raids."" The strikes came as US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (mainly Arab and Kurdish forces) said they had encircled a stronghold of DAESH militants in Manbij northern Syria cutting off a major supply route. On June 1 Daraya received its first shipment of medical aid. ""The last time people were filling the streets waiting for the aid to come in"" activist Shadi Matar told AFP from inside Daraya.

Condemning air strikes United States State Department spokesperson Mark Toner slammed the air strikes on Daraya. ""Such attacks are unacceptable in any circumstance but in this case they also hampered the delivery and distribution of badly needed assistance"". French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault also accused Damascus of ""extraordinary duplicity"" over the bombings. Ayrault said he was ""outraged beyond words"" declaring the end of the Russian-US brokered ""cessation of hostilities"" deal. According to deal the warring sides would stop fighting each other. It does not include DAESH and Al Qaeda-affiliated al Nusra Front.

265,,,Saturday 20 August 2016 Syrian Coalition Urges Intl Community to Stop Crimes by Regime and Russia against Syrian Civilians. The Syrian Coalition called on the European Union the United States and friends of the Syrian people to take immediate action in order to stop crimes carried out by the Assad regime and Russia against civilians in Syria. The Assad regime backed by Russia and allied forces continues with the campaign of terror against the Syrian people. The Coalition warned that mass killings destruction and displacement by the Assad regime and its allies undermine all chances of reaching a political settlement needed to end the suffering of the Syrian people. Activists in northern rural Homs said that the Assad regime and Russian forces have recently intensified aerial attacks on rebel-held areas. At least 13 civilians were killed and 30 others wounded in airstrikes by regime and Russian fighter jets on the town of Alghantou on Friday. Airstrikes also targeted the nearby towns of Rastan Talbeesah Ter Maaleh and Zafarana. Meanwhile Albir hospital and civilian homes in the district of Alwaer in Homs were subject to intense regime shelling on Friday with reports of civilian casualties. Activists said that the Assad regime has recently resorted to spreading rumors and misinformation to instill fear among residents of the district; a tactic Russia used in Ukraine. The Coalition stressed that the barbaric crimes death and destruction the Assad regime and its allies have been wreaking in Syria will not succeed in breaking the will of the Syrian people.

The so-called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) militant group has executed 700 members of a tribe it has been battling in eastern Syria during the past two weeks the majority of them civilians a human rights monitoring group says. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which has tracked violence on all sides of the three-year-old conflict said on Saturday that reliable sources reported beheadings were used to execute many of the al-Sheitaat tribe which is from Deir al-Zour province. The conflict between ISIL and the al-Sheitaat tribe who number about 70000 flared after the militants took over two oil fields in July. Those who were executed are all al-Sheitaat Observatory director Rami Abdel-Rahman said by telephone from Britain. Some were arrested judged and killed. Straddling parts of Iraq and Syria ISIL has swept across northern Iraq in recent weeks pushing back Kurdish regional forces and driving tens of thousands of Muslims Christians and members of the Yazidi religious minority from their homes. The insurgents are also tightening their grip in parts of Syria of which they now control roughly a third mostly rural areas in the north and east. An activist in Deir al-Zour who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters that 300 men were executed in one day in the town of Ghraneij one of the three main towns of the al-Sheitaat tribal heartland when ISIL stormed the town earlier this week. Another opposition activist from Deir al-Zour said residents of al-Sheitaat towns had been given three days to leave. Civilians fleeing al-Sheitaat towns had either taken sanctuary in other villages or travelled to Iraq he said.

Dominic Evans Khaled Yacoub Oweis. Syrias opposition accused government forces of gassing hundreds of people on Wednesday by firing rockets that released deadly fumes over rebel-held Damascus suburbs killing men women and children as they slept. With the death toll estimated between 500 and 1300 what would be the worlds most lethal chemical weapons attack since the 1980s prompted an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council in New York. The council did not explicitly demand a U.N. investigation of the incident although it said clarity was needed and welcomed U.N. chief Ban Ki-moons calls for a prompt investigation by the U.N. inspection team in Syria led by Ake Sellstrom. An earlier Western-drafted statement submitted to the council seen by Reuters was not approved. The final version of the statement was watered down to accommodate objections from Russia and China diplomats said. Moscow and Beijing have vetoed previous Western efforts to impose U.N. penalties on Assad. Syrian Information Minister Omran Zoabi said the allegations were illogical and fabricated. President Bashar al-Assads officials have said they would never use poison gas against Syrians. The United States and European allies believe Assads forces have used small amounts of sarin before hence the current U.N. visit. Immediate international action is likely to be limited with the divisions among major powers that have crippled efforts to quell 2 1/2 years of civil war still much in evidence. Russia backed up Syrian government denials by saying it looked like a rebel provocation to discredit Assad. Britain voiced the opposite view: I hope this will wake up some who have supported the Assad regime to realize its murderous and barbaric nature Foreign Secretary William Hague said on a visit to Paris. France Britain the United States and others called for an immediate on-site investigation by U.N. chemical weapons inspectors who arrived in the Syrian capital only this week. Moscow urging an objective inquiry said the very presence of that team suggested government forces were not to blame. U.S. President Barack Obama has made the use of chemical weapons by Assads forces a red line that in June triggered more U.S. aid to the rebels. But previous smaller and disputed cases of their deployment have not brought the all-out military intervention rebel leaders have sought to break a stalemate. U.S. Senator John McCain a Republican critic of Obamas Syria policy said on Twitter that failure to penalize previous gas attacks had emboldened Assad: No consequence for Assad using chemical weapons & crossing red line he said. We shouldnt be surprised hes using them again. Images including some by freelance photographers supplied to Reuters showed scores of bodies - some of them small children - laid on the floor of a clinic with no visible signs of injury. Some showed people with foam around their mouths. A boy who survived from what activists say is a gas attack cries as he takes shelter inside a mosque in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus August 21 2013. REUTERS/Mohamed Abdullah The United States and others said it had no independent confirmation that chemical weapons had been used. The U.N. chief Ban said the head of the inspection team in Damascus was already discussing the latest claims with the government. SLEEPING DEAD Opposition activists cited death tolls ranging from about 500 to - by one account - some 1300 after shells and rockets fell around 3 a.m. (0000 GMT) on Wednesday. In 1988 3000 to 5000 Iraqi Kurds were gassed by Saddam Husseins forces at Halabja. One man who said he had retrieved victims in the suburb of Erbin told Reuters: We would go into a house and everything was in its place. Every person was in their place. They were lying where they had been. They looked like they were asleep. Slideshow (21 Images) Doctors interviewed described symptoms they believe point to sarin gas one of the agents Western powers accuse Damascus of having in an undeclared chemical weapons stockpile. An opposition monitoring group citing figures compiled from clinics in the Damascus suburbs put the death toll at 494 with 90 percent killed by gas the rest by bombs and conventional arms. The rebel Syrian National Coalition said 650 people died. Activists said rockets with chemical agents hit the Damascus suburbs of Ain Tarma Zamalka and Jobar during a fierce pre-dawn bombardment by government forces. The Damascus Media Office said 150 bodies were counted in Hammouriya 100 in Kfar Batna 67 in Saqba 61 in Douma 76 in Mouadamiya and 40 in Erbin. A nurse at Douma Emergency Collection facility Bayan Baker said: Many of the casualties are women and children. They arrived with their pupils constricted cold limbs and foam in their mouths. The doctors say these are typical symptoms of nerve gas victims. Extensive amateur video and photographs appeared on the Internet showing victims choking some foaming at the mouth. A video purportedly shot in the Kafr Batna neighborhood showed a room filled with more than 90 bodies many of them children and a few women and elderly men. Most of the bodies appeared ashen or pale but with no visible injuries. Other footage showed doctors treating people in makeshift clinics. One video showed the bodies of a dozen people lying on the floor of a clinic. A voice-over said they were members of a single family. In a corridor outside lay another five bodies. Syria is one of just a handful of countries that are not parties to the international treaty that bans chemical weapons and Western nations believe it has caches of undeclared mustard gas sarin and VX nerve agents.

41,,,"Date of publication 19 August 2016 The uneasy peace in Syrias Hassakeh city was broken two days ago as clashes between regime and Kurdish forces escalated leading to Damascus to bomb separatist positions. Tags Qamishli Rojava Hassakeh Kurdish Syrian-Kurdish YPG Peoples Protection Units Turkey Syrian regime Syrian regime warplanes bombed Kurdish positions in the north-eastern city of Hassakeh on Friday as fighting between the two sides continued for a second day. The regime launched eight air raids - on the citys Kurdish-run south-western neighbourhoods - on Friday after an uneasy truce between regime and Kurdish militias broke down earlier this week leading to the latest bout of fighting. Images showed footage the city - reportedly Hassakeh - burning last night following one air raid. Control for Hassakeh city - the capital of the north-eastern province by the same name - is mostly in the hands of Kurdish forces while the rest is held by regime loyalists. Clashes between the two sides have rocked the city leaving 23 civilians - including nine children - dead according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Bombing and fighting has forced thousands of Hassakeh locals to flee in one of the most intense confrontations between the two sides in months. Thursdays air raids on Hassakeh were the first time the regime had bombarded Kurdish positions from the air. Damascus forces and Kurdish fighters have enjoyed a truce while the Islamic State group threatens the province and other Kurdish areas jointly controlled by the two sides. In Hassakeh and Qamishli tensions have led to armed clashes. Kurdish units have proclaimed independence of an autonomous region around the Turkish border and deeper into Syria and demanded that the pro-regime militias disband in Hassakeh. A regime source in Hassakeh told AFP that the bombing was ""a message to the Kurds that they should stop this sort of demand that constitutes an affront to national sovereignty"". Kurdish militias are key US allies in the fight against IS providing them with weapons and advisers on the battlefield. The US has also reportedly opened up an air base in Kurdish-controlled Syrian territory while Russia - which is helping prop up the regime - is also close to the Kurdish units.

The attacks were carried out in a blatant violation of UN Security Council resolutions 2118 and 2235 banning the use of chemical weapons and toxic substances. In a press release issued earlier on Tuesday the Syrian Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to shoulder its responsibilities towards stopping such attacks. It stressed that urgent measures must be taken under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations to protect the Syrian people. Any further delay in taking firm stance towards such attacks will open the door to more crimes and violations by the Assad regime the Coalition said. Separately over 12 civilians were killed and dozens injured including women and children when Russian jets raided the village of Abu Alduhour in rural Idlib on Monday. Five civilians were also killed in similar attacks on the village of Tal Toughan in rural Idlib. Activists said that the bombings were carried out by Russian forces in revenge for the death of five crewmen killed when their helicopter crashed near the town of Saraqib on Monday. The Syrian Coalition emphasized the need for the international community to assume its responsibilities regarding the protection of civilians in accordance with International Law (IL) and International Humanitarian Law (IHL) to stop war crimes and eliminate the constant threat of the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime.
