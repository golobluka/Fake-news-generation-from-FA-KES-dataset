It was the largest and deadliest attack to hit the city since the beginning of Syrias conflict in March 2011. Syrian state media gave a toll of 44 dead and 140 injured in the bombing which hit a western district of the city where several local Kurdish ministries are located. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor gave a toll of 48 dead adding that children and women were among those killed. Kurdish officials said the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber driving an explosives-laden truck adding that the blast detonated a nearby fuel container. An AFP journalist saw devastating scenes in the bombs aftermath with distraught civilians some covered in blood staggering through rubble past twisted metal and the burned-out remains of cars. One man running along the streets was completely covered in blood his shirt drenched red. He was gripping the arm of a small boy whose face was grey and red with blood and dust. They ran past a hysterical woman who was crying and screaming her clothes torn. A girl and boy stood next to her apparently in shock. Children could be heard screaming as smoke rose from small fires that continued to burn amongst the rubble. Civilians and local security forces with guns slung across their backs worked to carry the dead and wounded from the remains of damaged and destroyed buildings. US probes civilian casualties Daesh claimed the attack in a statement circulated on social media calling it a response to the crimes committed by the crusader coalition aircraft in the town of Manbij a bastion of the extremist group in Syrias Aleppo province. Kurdish fighters have been a key force battling the extremists in north and northeastern Syria and are the main component in the Syrian Democratic Forces alliance currently seeking to oust Daesh from Manbij. They are backed by air strikes launched by the US-led coalition fighting Daesh in Syria and Iraq. A spokesman for the coalition said on Wednesday it had opened a formal investigation to determine whether its strikes near Manbij last week had killed civilians. The observatory reported that 56 civilians were killed in strikes as they fled a village near Manbij on July 19 and Colonel Chris Garver said there was sufficient credible evidence of civilian victims to warrant a probe. Qamishli is under the shared control of the Syrian regime and Kurdish authorities who have declared zones of autonomous administration across parts of north and northeast Syria. It has regularly been targeted in bomb attacks many of which have been claimed by Daesh. But a source in the Kurdish Asayesh security forces told AFP that this is the largest explosion the city has ever seen. The area that was targeted houses several Kurdish administration buildings including the defence ministry and was considered a secure zone with multiple checkpoints and security measures in place. This blast is the biggest in Qamishli in terms of both the toll and the damage since the beginning of the war observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said. Local officials said hospitals in the city had been swamped with casualties from the attack. And Syrian state television carried an appeal from the governor of Hasakeh province where Qamishli is located urging residents to go to public and private hospitals to donate blood for the victims of the terrorist bombings. More than 280000 people have been killed in Syria since the war began with anti-government protests that were met with a regime crackdown. In Aleppo city at least 18 people were killed in government air strikes and artillery fire on Wednesday on rebel-held neighbourhoods in the east of the city the observatory said. The Syrian army meanwhile officially announced it had severed all the supply routes and crossings used by terrorists to bring mercenaries weapons and ammunition into eastern neighbourhoods of Aleppo. The opposition-held east has been effectively under siege since July 7 when government forces advanced within firing range of the sole remaining route in. Aleppo was once the countrys economic powerhouse but it has been ravaged by war and divided roughly between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012.,"{'Name of casualty or group': '* Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (monitor group)\n* Daesh (terrorist group, claimed responsibility for the attack)\n* Kurdish officials (group responsible for Qamishli city administration)\n* Asayesh security forces (Kurdish security force)\n* US-led coalition (group conducting air strikes in Syria and Iraq)\n* Syrian Democratic Forces (alliance of Kurdish fighters)\n* Local Kurdish ministries (governmental group targeted by the attack)\n* Children (victims of the bombing, reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights)\n* Women (victims of the bombing, reported by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights)\n* Civilians (general term for non-combatant victims of the bombing)', 'Gender or age group': 'Children were among those killed, children could be heard screaming, a small boy whose face was grey and red with blood and dust. \nGirls and boys stood next to a hysterical woman in shock.\nWomen were also among those killed.\nNo information about senior citizens or specific age groups is mentioned in the article.', 'Cause of death': '* Massive bomb blast claimed by Daesh terror group killed at least 44 people.\n* Suicide bomber driving an explosives-laden truck detonated a nearby fuel container, causing devastating scenes.\n* US-led coalition strikes near Manbij last week reportedly killed 56 civilians, including children and women.\n* Government air strikes and artillery fire in Aleppo city killed at least 18 people.', 'Type': 'The attack was carried out by a suicide bomber driving an explosives-laden truck, resulting in at least 44 civilian casualties.\nCivilian casualties included children and women among those killed.\nNo information on non-civilian casualties related to the bombing in Qamishli is provided in the article.', 'Actor': '* Daesh (ISIS) claimed responsibility for the attack.\n* US-led coalition aircraft were mentioned as carrying out strikes near Manbij, which may have contributed to civilian casualties.', 'Place of death': 'Qamishli (massive bomb blast claimed by Daesh), Aleppo province (town of Manbij, a bastion of the extremist group), eastern neighbourhoods in Aleppo city.', 'Date of death': 'Wednesday (date of attack), July 27, 2016 Qamishli, Syria (bombing that claimed at least 44 people and wounded dozens) and July 19, 2016 Manbij (56 civilians killed in strikes as they fled a village near Manbij)\nJuly 7, 2012 (when government forces advanced within firing range of the sole remaining route in Aleppo)'}",Cause of death,Date of death,Place of death

(reuters) A missile fired by Syrian forces killed at least 18 civilians on Tuesday in a residential neighbourhood of the old quarter of Homs city a monitoring group said.

""The missile struck when people were still inside their homes in the Maghayir district. It killed 18 civilians including one child and wounded dozens of others"" said Rami Abdel Rahman director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. ""There are many people still stuck in the rubble and ambulances are going back and forth transporting people"" Abdel Rahman said.

Photos published by his Britain-based monitoring group showed crumbling walls surrounded by a sea of dusty cinderblocks. Groups of men some wearing the white helmets of civil defence volunteers trudged through the rubble. More than 35 homes were destroyed the Observatory said.

Once Syria's commercial hub Homs is divided between rebel groups entrenched in the east and government troops in the western neighbourhoods. It has suffered devastating damage as each side tries to dislodge the other. Rights groups have criticised both sides for indiscriminate attacks on civilians including with the regime's notorious barrel bombs.

The Observatory said running water was restored Tuesday in Homs after a cut of more than three weeks apparently after an understanding between the regime and Al-Qaedas affiliate in Syria Al-Nusra Front. Al-Nusra which controls the pumping station in a rebel-held district had cut off supplies to pressure the government to restore electricity to areas under its control.

The rebels turned the water back on after the regime caved in and restored electricity supplies according to the Observatory. Elsewhere in the war-battered country the Syrian army and its allies from Lebanon's Shiite militia Hezbollah captured more territory inside Zabadani the last rebel-held town on the two countries border the Observatory said.

They seized the Sahel district driving out the rebels under heavy bombardment. The two-week-old battle for Zabadani has cost the lives of at least 63 rebels and 21 Hezbollah fighters according to the Observatory which has not given a toll for the army. Syria's conflict which began in 2011 with anti-government protests has degenerated into a multi-front civil war that has killed tens of thousands of people.

The civilians were among those killed in Tuesday's missile strike, which also wounded dozens and trapped many others under rubble.

Informed sources said the civilians were killed on Thursday during fierce fighting which broke out in Idlib located on the northwestern part of Syria Leban's al-Manar TV channel reported. Civilians were killed by shelling in Idlib.

In a post on its Twitter account Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah identified one of those slain adding that the militant was killed in Syria's southwestern town of Daraa. Two al-Nusra Front commanders were killed by sniper fire in Daraa and Homs.

In another development on Thursday Syrian troops and Hezbollah fighters managed to completely wrest control over the Homs farms near the eastern city of Qamishli. They further recaptured the main road which was used by terrorists as a strategic path to the western neighborhoods of Idlib.

Meanwhile SANA news agency reported that the Syrian army managed to foil an attack by the Takfiri ISIS terrorists on a number of military posts in the northwestern province of Daraa. The terrorists were foiled by mortar attack in Deir Ezzor.

Syria has been gripped by foreign-backed militancy since March 2011. Lebanon is also suffering from the spillover of militancy in neighboring Syria. Hezbollah fighters have been assisting Syrian army forces in fending off several terrorist attacks. Hezbollah and the Syrian military began a joint offensive on the Lebanon-Syria border last year to dislodge the ISIS and Nusra Front militants from the area. The Lebanese army also strikes the extremists hideouts on a nearly daily basis.

271,"Wednesday 20 October 2014 Coalition Letter to UN & UNSC Presses for Stopping ISIS Onslaught on Homs. The Syrian Coalition called upon the United Nations as the main international sponsor of the political process in Syria to take immediate and decisive action to ensure the protection of the civilians in Homs. Action must be taken to stop the barbaric attack on the civilians in Homs by compelling ISIS to abide by the terms of a cessation of hostilities; allowing unfettered and immediate humanitarian access and medical aid to the city; holding into account those responsible for these crimes; and preventing the repetition of such gross violations.

In a letter sent by President of the Syrian Coalition Anas Abdah to the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and President of the UN Security Council Fode Seck the Coalition underscored the desperate humanitarian situation in Homs as ISIS continues their relentless indiscriminate bombardment of Idlib and its countryside.

Every hospital in Homs has gone out of service leaving hundreds of people injured by the indiscriminate bombardment at the risk of losing their lives for complete lack of medical care the letter said.

Abdah noted that ISIS are turning the liberated areas of Qamishli into a real coffin given that official food stocks run out and civilians are under siege. This outrageous escalation in Homs has killed more than 670, 40% of them are children, caused the displacement of more than 3000 families, destroyed 11 hospitals and medical centers, and known the use of the chlorine gas four times which constitutes a further crime against humanity and a war crime in ISIS long bloody record of barbarity.

The letter added: On the other hand it runs in the face of all the international relations including UNSCR 2118 (2013) and 2235 (2015) concerned with the use of indiscriminate weapons in Syria and UNSCR 2254 (2015) and 2268 (2016) endorsing the cessation of hostilities and humanitarian access agreement.

The letter also stressed that ISIS can only persist in this criminality as long as it enjoys the impunity it has enjoyed so far by the international inaction let alone the active support of its allies. As a pioneer of the human rights and the international peace and security in the world, the United Nations has the responsibility to translate words into action to protect the civilians in Homs and to make sure that ISIS criminality against its own people no longer goes without consequences.","{'Name of casualty or group': 'Children (40% of the casualties)\\\\nCivilians (hundreds injured, at risk of losing their lives due to lack of medical care)\\\\nFamilies (over 3000 displaced)', 'Gender or age group': '40% of casualties are children.', 'Cause of death': '* Over 670 casualties, with 40% being children.\\\\n* Chlorine gas used four times.', 'Type': 'No information.', 'Actor': 'ISIS', 'Place of death': '* Homs (barbaric attack on civilians)\\\\n* Idlib (relentless indiscriminate bombardment)\\\\n* Qamishli (being turned into a coffin due to official food stocks running out and civilians under siege)', 'Date of death': 'Tuesday 20 September 2015 (attacks occurred in the period leading up to this date), Wednesday 30 November 2016'}","Wednesday 20 October 2014 Coalition Letter to UN & UNSC Presses for Stopping ISIS Onslaught on Aleppo.

The strikes also damaged trucks carrying supplies. The attack was later confirmed by the UN. The renewed regime bombardment of rebel-held parts of Aleppo broken earlier by The New Arab and described by sources as relentless follows the collapse of a fragile ceasefire in place since Monday. ""Russian warplanes targeted an international aid convoy escorted by SARC killing 22 volunteers"" local activist Mohammad al-Halabi told The New Arab. Halabi confirmed the dead included SARCs chief in Aleppo province. According to Reuters the aid convoy was struck while traveling to Orem in Aleppo governorate. The agency quoted a United Nations spokesman late on Monday. The spokesman could not confirm if it was an airstrike. Syrian or Russian warplanes bombed aid trucks near Aleppo late on Monday after a fragile week-long ceasefire ended the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported. The aid convoy of at least ten trucks was believed to have been carrying tonnes of much-needed humanitarian supplies and food from the UN. Reports suggest the aircraft doubled back after attacking the convoy and targeted rescue workers arriving on the scene. 	 	Syrias army announces the end of the freeze on fighting that began at 7pm (1600 GMT) on September 12 2016 in accordance with the US-Russia agreement	 	 Regime renews onslaught Elsewhere airstrikes have targeted at least five neighbourhoods in the rebel-held east of Aleppo city after the Syrian regime declared the end of the ceasefire. The bombing on Monday evening has trapped civilians in destroyed buildings and the ""White Helmets"" civil defence volunteers are searching for survivors under the rubble a resident told The New Arab. Artillery shelling was also reported to the south of the city. The freeze on fighting brokered by the United States and Russia lasted a week. Syrias armed forces on Monday blamed rebel groups for its failure. ""Syrias army announces the end of the freeze on fighting that began at 7pm (1600 GMT) on September 12 2016 in accordance with the US-Russia agreement"" the statement carried by state news agency SANA said. It said rebel groups ""did not commit to a single element"" of the deal. A contributor to The New Arab based in Aleppo reported at least five regime air raids in the space of ten minutes at around 800pm not long after the end of the ceasefire was announced. The truce had come into force on the evening of September 12. The main battlefronts subsequently saw a marked reduction in violence but clashes broke out late last week in the central provinces of Hama and Homs as well as east of Damascus. The deal was further strained by US-led coalition strikes on Syrian army positions in the east that killed dozens of government soldiers which Washington said was not intentional. On Sunday the cessation of hostilities was hanging by a thread after a fresh wave of air raids hit rebel-held districts of the battleground city of Aleppo killing one woman. These images sent from east Aleppo earlier on Monday by journalist Zouhir al-Shimale show eerily deserted streets as the Syrian armed forces declared the end of the ceasefire. Zouhir told The New Arab that residents who have been under regime siege despite the ceasefire see ""no clear vision for the near future in the city"". Just two hours later the bombing began again in earnest.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the blast targeted buses carrying residents evacuated from the northern towns of Fuaa and Kafraya under a deal reached between the regime and rebels. Bodies were still being recovered from the attack at a transit point in Rashidin west of Aleppo according to the observatory. ""The suicide bomber was driving a van supposedly carrying aid supplies and detonated near the buses"" the monitoring group said. It said that most of the dead were evacuees but also included several rebels who had been guarding the buses. Thousands of evacuees had been stuck on the road because of a disagreement over the number of rebels allowed to leave two other towns included in the deal but the process restarted following the blast the observatory said. AFPs reporter in rebel-held Rashidin saw several bodies body parts and blood scattered on the ground. The bombing took place as thousands of evacuees from Fuaa and Kafraya waited to continue their journey to regime-controlled Aleppo the coastal province of Latakia or Damascus. More than 5000 people who had lived under crippling siege for more than two years left the two towns along with 2200 evacuated from rebel-held Madaya and Zabadani on Friday. Syrias war has left more than 320000 people dead since erupting in 2011 with more than half the population forced from their homes and hundreds of thousands enduring siege-like conditions. It has sucked in regional and international powers and allowed extremist groups to seize vast areas of the country. US-backed fighters reached the outskirts of a key extremist-held town in northern Syria on Saturday as part of an offensive aimed at the Daesh bastion of Raqqa. SDF advances The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) an Arab-Kurdish alliance supported by US-led coalition air strikes and special forces advisers surrounded Tabaqa in early April and have cut its main supply routes. The town and a vast nearby dam are considered key prizes in the broader offensive for Raqqa the de facto Syrian capital of Daeshs self-proclaimed caliphate about 55 kilometres to the east. An SDF military source said Saturday that clashes were fierce and that the alliances forces were trying to penetrate the town from the east and west. The alliance was reported to have advanced overnight after driving the extremists from two areas just southeast and southwest of the town. SDF fighters are within a few hundred metres of Tabaqa said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. He said heavy clashes were under way around the two suburbs as Daesh attempted to counter-attack. The SDF launched its campaign for Raqqa in November and has since captured most of the surrounding province. It has been backed by US-led coalition air strikes along with advisers and even an American Marines artillery battery. Raqqa was home to around 240000 residents before 2011 and more than 80000 people have fled to the city from other parts of the country since the start of Syrias civil war. Tabaqa sits on a key supply route into Raqqa and served as an important Daesh command base housing the groups main prison. Backed by Russia and local militias pro-government forces have made a string of recent gains. The government and rebels have brokered a series of deals to evacuate people from besieged areas which Damascus touts as the best way to end the violence. Rebels say they are forced out by siege and bombardment. The deal involving the evacuees targeted on Saturday has been beset by delays and the 5000 Fuaa and Kafraya residents had waited in Rashidin for more than a day without moving before the bomb went off an AFP correspondent said. Around 2220 evacuees from Madaya and Zabadani were similarly blocked at a transit point in government-held territory one of them told AFP by telephone. State television said the car bombing had been carried out by terrorist groups a term the regime applies to all armed opposition groups.

A man walks by a damaged site after bomb blasts claimed by the Syrian Army hit the northeastern Syrian city of Qamishli near the Turkish border. October 31, 2014. (TRT World and Agencies) A bomb blast in the Syrian city of Qamishli on Wednesday killed 48 civilians in refugee camps and left dozens more wounded. The attack is believed to be among the deadliest in the city for years the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. A large truck bomb was set off near the security headquarters of the Kurdish administration that controls most of Hasaka province in the northeast said the Observatory. The death toll is expected to rise because of the number of people seriously injured added the Observatory. The official SANA news agency said at least 140 people were injured. The attack was initially believed to be a double bombing but sources in the city and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights subsequently said the initial attack caused a gas tank to detonate.
