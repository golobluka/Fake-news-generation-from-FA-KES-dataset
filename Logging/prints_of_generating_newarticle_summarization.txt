Original article:  Published July 2 2016 At least 16 civilians including women and children were killed Friday during an air raid by the Syrian regime army on the opposition-held neighborhood of Tareeq al-Bab in Aleppo Syrias largest city according to a pro-opposition civil defense source on the ground. The missiles fired from a Syrian warplane also wounded 25 others Ibrahim Abu Leys told Anadolu Agency. Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the Bashar al-Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests - which erupted as part of the "Arab Spring" uprisings - with unexpected ferocity and disproportionate force. Since then more than a quarter of a million people have been killed - and more than 10 million displaced - throughout the war-battered country according to the UN. The Syrian Center for Policy Research an NGO however has put the death toll from the five-year conflict at as high as 470000.

Original article:  Wednesday 10 August 2016 20:02 Syrian Coalition: Targeting Civilians Is Terrorism Pure and Simple as over 19 Civilians Killed in Russian Airstrikes on Rural Deir Ezzor. Activists said that at least 19 civilians including women and children were killed and dozens more wounded in airstrikes believed to be carried out by the Russian air force on the village of Almehemdiya in western rural Deir Ezzor. The Syrian Coalition strongly condemned the attack on Almehemdiya and the targeting of civilians across Syria especially the escalating Russian aggression on Syria after rebels managed to break the siege on Aleppo. The Coalition rejected any and all excuses used to justify the bombings in Syria stressing that targeting civilians including women and children cannot not be justified by fighting terror. Whether it was with a knife or an aircraft any attack on civilians is terrorism pure and simple the Coalition added. Meanwhile over 10 civilians were also killed and 18 more wounded in Russian airstrikes and barrel bomb attacks on the neighborhoods of Karam Alnozha and Tal Alzarazir in Aleppo on Tuesday. Activists in Daraya west of Damascus said that the rebel-held district was pounded with a barrage of barrel bombs as well as artillery and rocket shells while violent clashes between FSA fighters and regime forces on the outskirts of the district were reported.

Original article:  Last updated at Jul 262016 BEIRUT Syrian government forces on Tuesday seized a rebel-held neighbourhood in the northwest edge of Aleppo tightening their siege of opposition-controlled parts of the city a monitor said. The government also carried out renewed barrel bomb attacks on opposition-held districts a day after bombardments killed at least 24 people the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based monitor said regime troops had full control of the Leramun district after heavy clashes. It also reported intense fighting for neighbouring rebel-held district of Bani Zeid. The two areas have been used by rebels to launch rockets into government-held districts in the citys west. Aleppo has been roughly divided between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012. In recent weeks regime advances have severed the only remaining route into the rebel-held eastern neighbourhoods effectively placing them under siege. Opposition forces have responded by firing missiles into government districts killing scores of civilians. "The importance of capturing Leramun and Bani Zeid is to stop the missile fire and also to further tighten the siege" said observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman. He said government forces had now surrounded Bani Zeid reporting heavy air strikes in the area and clashes. The monitor had no immediate toll in the fighting. Government forces effectively severed the oppositions main supply route on July 7 when they advanced to within firing range of the Castello Road. They have since tightened the encirclement of the rebel-held east taking parts of the road itself and causing food shortages and spiralling prices in opposition neighbourhoods. Syrias Al Watan daily which is close to the government also reported advances in Leramun an industrial area that once housed scores of factories. State news agency SANA broadcast a call from the military urging residents of eastern Aleppo to "join the national reconciliation and expel the foreign mercenaries" from their neighbourhoods. It said the army had sent text messages to residents and fighters in the east urging rebels to lay down their weapons and identifying safe passages for civilians wishing to leave. Government forces continued to pound opposition areas on Tuesday with the observatory reporting a new barrel bomb attack on the district of Al Mashhad. It said five civilians including three children were killed. On Monday at least 24 people including five children and two women were killed in a barrel bomb attack on the same neighbourhood according to a new toll from the observatory. A statement from the UN childrens agency UNICEF on Tuesday condemned weekend air raids on four hospitals in Aleppo calling them a blatant violation of international humanitarian law that may amount to war crimes. On the humanitarian front a 48-truck aid convoy on Tuesday entered regime-besieged Talbiseh in Homs province with food and other supplies for 40000 people the International Committee of the Red Cross said. More than 280000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests that were met with a regime crackdown.

Original article:  32 killed in Syrias Daraa Aleppo NGO Friday 15 Aug 2014 Print Tweet Views 458 Related Lebanon charges 43 Syrians with belonging to terrorist groups 2000 Syria refugees stranded in Lebanon mountains Nun Morocco busts jihadist Iraq Syria recruitment network At least 22 people were killed Friday when a car bomb exploded in front of a mosque in Daraa province of southern Syria the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Among the dead in the blast in the rebel-controlled town of Namar were a woman and a child the Britain-based monitoring group said. In northern Syria the Observatory reported 10 people killed when regime helicopters dropped explosive-packed "barrel bombs" on Aleppo city. The attacks targeted the Bab al-Nairab district of the Old City and the southern Salahin neighbourhood. North of Aleppo city the Observatory said jihadists from the Islamic State (IS) group extended their advances seizing Baghaydin village near the border with Turkey. On Wednesday IS fighters captured eight villages in the area between Aleppo and the border from rival rebel groups. Those advances came after clashes that killed at least 40 fighters from rebel groups as well as 12 IS fighters according to the Observatory. The successes open the way for IS to move towards two strategic prizes - Aazaz and Marea. Marea is a stronghold of the Islamic Front a coalition of Islamist groups that is among those fighting against IS. Aazaz sits next to a border crossing with Turkey which would be a valuable asset as IS seeks to expand its self-declared "caliphate" in the territory it holds in Syria and neighbouring Iraq. IS emerged from Al-Qaedas one-time branch in Iraq and initially fought alongside Syrias opposition including more moderate rebels and Al-Nusra fighters. But its abuses and harsh brand of religion prompted a backlash from rebel groups that pushed it out of many opposition-held areas earlier this year. Since then it has staged a comeback bolstered by weaponry obtained in advances across the border in Iraq. One analyst warned Friday that the fate of Syrias "Western-backed opposition in northern Syria hangs quite literally on a knife-edge" as IS advances in northern Aleppo and regime forces advance in Aleppo city. In an opinion piece published on CNNs website Charles Lister of the Brookings Doha Centre said Syrias rebels were facing an "existential threat". Lister said IS was likely to move into Aazaz cutting rebel supply lines to Syria and into Marea from which it could launch attacks on rebel-held parts of Aleppo city. Aleppo has been divided between rebel control in the east and regime control in the west since shortly after fighting began there in mid-2012. In the face of regime advances around the eastern outskirts of the city coupled with IS advances farther north the remaining rebels inside Aleppo are increasingly beleaguered. Fighting in the province has left civilians there "living in appalling conditions" the International Committee of the Red Cross said on Friday. The ICRC said it was working with Syrias Red Crescent to deliver medical aid to all parts of the province in both rebel- and regime-held territory. "Stepping up aid distributions in the governorate has been the ICRCs priority ever since we established a permanent presence in the city over a year ago" it said. More than 170000 people have been killed in Syria since the beginning of its conflict in March 2011 according to the Observatory.

The death toll from twin the terrorist ugly explosions in the Syrian province of Homs rose to 32 and more than 115 wounded persons most of them children and several sustaining critical injuries. Two terrorist bombings hit an area near a school compound in Ikrima neighborhood in Homs city on Wednesday. A source in the central province said that terrorists detonated up a car bomb in front of the New Ikrima School and only a few minutes later a suicide bomber blew himself up in front of Ikrima al-Makhzoumi School. The attacks took place at the time when students were leaving school to inflict maximum casualties. The source pointed out that the car bomb was made up of three gas cylinders each packed with 7 kg of C4 explosives and concealed in a Mazda. Prime Minister Dr. Wael al-Halqi condemned the twin terrorist blasts that rocked Homs city on Wednesday. These terrorist acts in which terrorists have taken their hatred out on our schoolchildren are meant to discourage Syrias children from pursuing knowledge he told SANA. The terrorist groups have been taken aghast by the Syrian armys military successes the Premier said which accounts for their resort to these cowardly acts. Al-Halqi said these terrorist acts will make us even stronger and more determined to restore security and stability all over Syria. In the same context Regional leadership of al-Baath Arab Socialist Part strongly condemned the twin terrorist explosions that targeted the students. In a statement the Partys leadership said that the terrorist twin explosions reveal again the brutality of terrorists and their hatred against the Syrian citizens who achieved a lot of victories over terrorism. Homs governor Talal al-Barazi said targeting safe children in their schools is an act of cowardice and a desperate attempt to undermine the steadfastness of Syria and reverse the state of security and stability in Homs province. Al-Barazi whose comments came during a visit he paid to the hospitals where the injured from Wednesday twin terrorist bombings lay said the internal security forces have facilitated the movement of ambulances which rushed to the site of the explosion to evacuate the victims and rescue the wounded. Director of Homs Health Directorate Dr. Hassan al-Jundi said the health sector is on high alert to take all necessary measures under these extraordinary circumstances. The twin terrorist bombings have taken the lives of scores most of them schoolchildren he added indicating that the injuries range in severity from moderate to severe.

However, if we consider the broader context of the article, it mentions that the death toll rose to 32 and more than 115 wounded persons, so it's likely that the attacks occurred on two separate days. Unfortunately, there is no specific information provided in the article about the exact dates when each attack took place.

During Sundays operation 23 DAESH terrorists were killed and three buildings one defensive position and an anti-tank rocket launcher were destroyed in northern Syria the sources said. The southeastern province of Kilis has faced a spate of cross-border rocket attacks from DAESH in recent months. Kilis has been under indiscriminate rocket attacks from neighboring Syria since mid-January. Twenty people in Kilis have been killed and almost 70 others wounded by rockets that fell in the city. Syrian Arab forces have also taken territory formerly held by DAESH in a bid to capture a strategic hub linking the terrorist group with the Turkish border. The Peoples Protection Units- (YPG) dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have seized 3 kilometers of territory to the northeast of the northern city of Manbij plus 6 kilometers to the south the Pentagon said on June 9. Recognizing DAESH as a terrorist organization on Oct. 10 2013 in an official declaration Turkey continues to fight DAESH both with military precautions along the Syrian border and with extensive investigations in the country to cut off supply and recruitment routes.

Original article:  Friday 19 Aug 2016 Syria regime pounds Kurdish positions for second day AFP Syrian regime warplanes bombarded the northeastern city of Hasakeh for the second day on Friday targeting positions held by Kurdish forces a monitor and a journalist in the city said. Fresh strikes came as the Pentagon said that US-led coalition fighter jets scrambled to protect Kurdish forces working with American advisers in Syria as they were targeted by regime planes Thursday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights - which monitors the conflict and determines which planes carry out raids according to their type location flight patterns and the munitions involved - said Fridays strikes were conducted by regime jets. The journalist in Hasakeh said eight air strikes could be heard throughout the day mostly focused in the citys southwestern neighbourhoods. Most of Hasakeh city the capital of the northeastern province by the same name is controlled by Kurdish forces while the rest is held by fighters loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. Since Wednesday clashes between the two forces have rocked the city leaving 23 civilians - including nine children - and 16 combattants dead the Observatory said. The Britain-based monitor said thousands of inhabitants had begun to flee Hasakeh where bread was running out and electricity supplies have been cut. Thursdays government raids on Hasakeh were the first time the regime had bombarded Kurdish positions from the air. The development prompted jets from the US-led coalition battling the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq to intervene in order to protect Kurdish forces working alongside US advisors a Pentagon spokesman said Friday. "This was done as a measure to protect coalition forces" Captain Jeff Davis said. "We did make clear that US aircraft would defend troops on the ground if threatened." The Kurdish Peoples Protection Units (YPG) are a key US ally in the fight against IS. Washington regards them as the most effective fighting force on the ground in Syria and has provided weapons and special forces military advisers. IS controls most of the Euphrates valley to the south of Hasakeh and tensions between regime and Kurdish forces have sometimes led to armed clashes in spite of their common jihadist enemy. The Kurds who control much of northeastern and northern Syria along the Turkish border where they have proclaimed an autonomous Kurdish region recently demanded that the pro-government National Defence Forces disband in Hasakeh. A government source in the city told AFP that the air strikes were "a message to the Kurds that they should stop this sort of demand that constitutes an affront to national sovereignty". More than 290000 people have been killed since Syrias conflict erupted in March 2011.

Original article:  Air strikes kill 11 including children in Syrias Idlib monitor AFP Wednesday 13 Jul 2016 At least 11 civilians including three children were killed in air strikes on a rebel-held town in Syrias northwestern Idlib province on Wednesday a monitor said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said it was unclear if the strikes on the town of Ariha in Idlib province were carried out by Syrian government or Russian war planes. The town is controlled by the Army of Conquest a rebel alliance of mainly Islamist groups including Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front that holds almost all of Idlib province. Video uploaded by activists purportedly showed the aftermath of the strikes with residents and civil defence workers picking though debris looking for survivors. Idlib has regularly been targeted by both Syrian government air strikes and raids carried out by its Russian ally. A longtime backer of the government in Damascus Moscow stepped up its support for President Bashar al-Assad on September 30 when it began an air campaign aimed at bolstering regime positions. Elsewhere in the country the Observatory said at least eight people were killed on Wednesday in the town of Rastan in central Homs province. Five of them died in air strikes on the towns market place which also wounded dozens of people. Another three were killed in shelling earlier Wednesday.

Original article:  Last updated at Jun 182016 BEIRUT At least seven people died in rebel shelling of a neighbourhood of the Syrian city of Aleppo held by the Kurdish YPG militia at dawn on Saturday a monitoring group said as rebels took territory to the south. More than 40 people were also wounded in the attack on the Sheikh Maqsoud area the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a district next to the only way in and out of rebel-held parts of the northern city the Castello road. An escalation in air and artillery strikes in recent weeks around the road has made it virtually impassable putting hundreds of thousands of people in Aleppo under effective siege. Hundreds of people have been killed in Aleppo since peace talks broke off in April as Syrias President Bashar Assad seeks to regain control of what was Syrias largest pre-war city now split between rebel and government sectors. Rebels have said in the past their attacks on Sheikh Maqsoud were in response to YPG attempts to cut the Castello road. The YPG controls nearly all of Syrias northern frontier with Turkey and has been a close ally of the United States in the campaign against Daesh in Syria. Many rebels in western Syria do not trust the YPG because they say it cooperates with Damascus rather than fighting it an accusation the YPG has denied Heavy bombardment Sheikh Maqsoud has been under intense bombardment since mid-February which has killed more than 132 civilians and injured around 900 more the observatory said. A 48-hour ceasefire in Aleppo announced by Russia on Thursday has had little impact on fighting and air strikes and shelling have continued in and around the city since then. Three people two of them children died and more than nine people were injured by barrel bombs dropped from helicopters in the city the observatory said on Saturday. The White Helmets a group of civil defence emergency workers operating in rebel-held areas said on Twitter one of their buildings in Haritan in the north Aleppo countryside was hit by an air strike on Saturday. There were no injuries. The observatory also said on Saturday that rebels had captured three villages south of Aleppo from government control Zeitan Khalsa and Barna causing significant losses among government forces and their allies. The villages are near a main highway within rebel territory linking Aleppo with the capital Damascus to the south. They lie in an area captured by government forces at the end of last year in a large offensive assisted by Iranian-backed militias and Russian airpower. But the Syrian observatory said there has been a lack of Russian air support during this weeks battle for these villages. At least 86 members of Syrian government forces and its allies who include members of the Lebanese group Hizbollah and other Iranian-backed militias were killed in fighting in the south Aleppo area in the past four days the observatory said. The numbers could not be independently confirmed. The rebels are fighting alongside Al Qaeda-affiliated Al Nusra Front which like the Daesh terror group was excluded from a February ceasefire and from the Geneva peace talks.

Here is the new JSON file:

{
    "Name of casualty or group": "Russian Forces personnel",
    "Gender or age group": "mix (including children)",
    "Cause of death": "rebel shelling",
    "Type": "civilian and non-civilian",
    "Actor": "Russian forces",
    "Place of death": "Sheikh Maqsoud area in Aleppo, Syria",
    "Date of death": "Saturday (no specific date mentioned)"
}

Now I will summarize the article with the new value for "Name of casualty or group".

BEGINNING OF THE ARTICLE
Last updated at Jun 18 2016 BEIRUT At least seven Russian Forces personnel died in rebel shelling of a neighbourhood of the Syrian city of Aleppo held by the Kurdish YPG militia at dawn on Saturday a monitoring group said as rebels took territory to the south. More than 40 people were also wounded in the attack on the Sheikh Maqsoud area the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a district next to the only way in and out of rebel-held parts of the northern city the Castello road. An escalation in air and artillery strikes in recent weeks around the road has made it virtually impassable putting hundreds of thousands of people in Aleppo under effective siege. Hundreds of people have been killed in Aleppo since peace talks broke off in April as Syrias President Bashar Assad seeks to regain control of what was Syrias largest pre-war city now split between rebel and government sectors. Rebels have said in the past their attacks on Sheikh Maqsoud were in response to YPG attempts to cut the Castello road. The YPG controls nearly all of Syrias northern frontier with Turkey and has been a close ally of the United States in the campaign against Daesh in Syria. Many rebels in western Syria do not trust the YPG because they say it cooperates with Damascus rather than fighting it an accusation the YPG has denied Heavy bombardment Sheikh Maqsoud has been under intense bombardment since mid-February which has killed more than 132 civilians and injured around 900 more the observatory said. A 48-hour ceasefire in Aleppo announced by Russia on Thursday has had little impact on fighting and air strikes and shelling have continued in and around the city since then. Three people two of them children died and more than nine people were injured by barrel bombs dropped from helicopters in the city the observatory said on Saturday. The White Helmets a group of civil defence emergency workers operating in rebel-held areas said on Twitter one of their buildings in Haritan in the north Aleppo countryside was hit by an air strike on Saturday. There were no injuries. The observatory also said on Saturday that rebels had captured three villages south of Aleppo from government control Zeitan Khalsa and Barna causing significant losses among government forces and their allies. The villages are near a main highway within rebel territory linking Aleppo with the capital Damascus to the south. They lie in an area captured by government forces at the end of last year in a large offensive assisted by Iranian-backed militias and Russian airpower. But the Syrian observatory said there has been a lack of Russian air support during this weeks battle for these villages. At least 86 members of Syrian government forces and its allies who include members of the Lebanese group Hizbollah and other Iranian-backed militias were killed in fighting in the south Aleppo area in the past four days the observatory said. The numbers could not be independently confirmed. The rebels are fighting alongside Al Qaeda-affiliated Al Nusra Front which like the Daesh terror group was excluded from a February ceasefire and from the Geneva peace talks.

Original article:  August 1 2011 Factbox: Syrias city of Hama site of new assault. Syrian tanks shelled the central city of Hama Monday killing four civilians residents said a day after rights groups said security forces killed 80 there in one of the bloodiest days of the five-month-old uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Here are some details about the city which was the site of a massacre in 1982: * 1982: - In the late 1970s and early 1980s Syrias Muslim Brotherhood sought to destabilize and unseat President Hafez al-Assad and his government through political assassinations and urban guerilla warfare. In February 1982 the Muslim Brotherhood ambushed government forces searching for dissidents in Hama. - Syrian government forces attacked the city razing the old quarters of Hama to crush the armed uprising by Brotherhood fighters who had taken refuge there. - Estimates of the death toll in the three weeks of operations in Hama vary from 10000 to more than 30000 out of a population of 350000. Syria then imprisoned much of the membership of the local Islamist group. - Syrian human rights groups said that women children and the elderly were among those killed in the crackdown and thousands were forced to flee the city. * 2011: - In June activists said Syrian forces killed at least 60 protesters in the city. Residents said security forces and snipers had fired on crowds of demonstrators. - Assad sacked the governor of Hama province on July 2 a day after tens of thousands of protesters massed in the provincial capital to demand the Syrian leader step down. - The demonstration in Hama was part of nationwide protests which activists said were some of the biggest since the uprising against Assads rule erupted in mid-March. - In a symbolic show of solidarity U.S. ambassador Robert Ford and French ambassador Eric Chevallier visited Hama on July 8 to put pressure on Assad not to crush the protest. Syria condemned the action and summoned them to Damascus on July 10. - Ford had only arrived in Damascus in January. After he posted a letter on the embassys Facebook page a mob stormed the embassy compound July 11 tearing down plaques. - On July 31 a tank-backed assault killed at least 80 people in Hama rights groups said. The state news agency said the military was purging armed groups that were terrorizing citizens. Monday tanks shelled a northeastern district of Hama killing four more civilians two residents said. * ABOUT HAMA: - Hama has been settled as far back as the Bronze Age and Iron Age. Famous for its citadel and its ancient Norias (waterwheels) the younger Assad and his government has sought to promote the city as a tourist destination. - Hama Syrias fourth biggest city has a mostly Sunni Muslim population of 700000. It lies about 210 km (131 miles) north of Damascus.

Here are some details about the city which was the site of a massacre in 1982: * 1982: - In the late 1970s and early 1980s Syrias Muslim Brotherhood sought to destabilize and unseat President Hafez al-Assad and his government through political assassinations and urban guerilla warfare. In February 1982 the Muslim Brotherhood ambushed government forces searching for dissidents in Hama. - Syrian government forces attacked the city razing the old quarters of Hama to crush the armed uprising by Brotherhood fighters who had taken refuge there. - Estimates of the death toll in the three weeks of operations in Hama vary from 10000 to more than 30000 out of a population of 350000. Syria then imprisoned much of the membership of the local Islamist group. - Syrian human rights groups said that women children and the elderly were among those killed in the crackdown and thousands were forced to flee the city. * 2011: - In June activists said Syrian forces killed at least 60 protesters in the city. Residents said security forces had fired on crowds of demonstrators using snipers. - Assad sacked the governor of Hama province on July 2 a day after tens of thousands of protesters massed in the provincial capital to demand the Syrian leader step down. - The demonstration in Hama was part of nationwide protests which activists said were some of the biggest since the uprising against Assads rule erupted in mid-March. - In a symbolic show of solidarity U.S. ambassador Robert Ford and French ambassador Eric Chevallier visited Hama on July 8 to put pressure on Assad not to crush the protest. Syria condemned the action and summoned them to Damascus on July 10. - Ford had only arrived in Damascus in January. After he posted a letter on the embassys Facebook page a mob stormed the embassy compound July 11 tearing down plaques. - On July 31 a tank-backed assault killed at least 80 people in Hama rights groups said. The state news agency said the military was purging armed groups that were terrorizing citizens. Monday rebel groups shelled a northeastern district of Hama but used snipers to kill four more civilians two residents said. * ABOUT HAMA: - Hama has been settled as far back as the Bronze Age and Iron Age. Famous for its citadel and its ancient Norias (waterwheels) the younger Assad and his government has sought to promote the city as a tourist destination. - Hama Syrias fourth biggest city has a mostly Sunni Muslim population of 700000. It lies about 210 km (131 miles) north of Damascus.

Original article:  Syria rebel infighting kills 45 fighters in 2 days AP Monday 9 Jun 2014 Activists say rebel infighting in Syria has killed 45 opposition fighters over the past two days. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the fighting flared up in eastern Deir el-Zour province on Sunday and continued into Monday. The Observatory says the clashes pitted al-Qaidas affiliate the Nusra Front against the al-Qaida breakaway Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The two jihadi groups were allies but had a falling out earlier this year and have since intermittently clashed in some of the fiercest rebel infighting in the Syrian civil war. The Observatory says a month of infighting in Dier el-Zour alone has killed nearly 300 fighters and displaced 100000 civilians. It has also weakened the Syrian oppositions resolve to overthrow President Bashar Assad.

Original article:  Air strikes in Syrias Idlib kill more than 20 Monitor Reuters Sunday 12 Jun 2016 Air strikes carried out by Syrian or Russian warplanes killed more than 20 people in the northwestern city of Idlib on Sunday monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. Areas hit included a market and at least five children were among those killed the British-based Observatory said. It said the death toll was expected to rise because of the number of people seriously wounded. It said it did not know whether Syrian or Russian jets had carried out the strikes. Both are operating in the area. Russia deployed warplanes to Syria last year to support President Bashar al-Assad against rebels seeking to end his rule and have supported Syrian government forces in a separate fight against Islamic State (IS) group further east. Idlib city and the province by the same name is a stronghold of rebel groups including the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. Air raids in the town of Maarat al-Numan about 30 km (20 miles) south of Idlib killed another six people the Observatory said. There has been heavy bombardment of areas in Idlib province in recent weeks including air strikes that killed at least 23 people last month. Fighting in Syrias five-year civil war has intensified since a February ceasefire deal which took hold in the west of the country but excluded al Qaeda and IS group but quickly began to unravel.

The attacks were carried out in a blatant violation of UN Security Council resolutions 2118 and 2235 banning the use of chemical weapons and toxic substances. In a press release issued earlier on Tuesday the Syrian Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to shoulder its responsibilities towards stopping such attacks. It stressed that urgent measures must be taken under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations to protect the Syrian people. Any further delay in taking firm stance towards such attacks will open the door to more crimes and violations by the Assad regime the Coalition said. Separately over 12 civilians were killed and dozens injured including women and children when Russian jets raided the village of Abu Alduhour in rural Idlib on Monday. Five civilians were also killed in similar attacks on the village of Tal Toughan in rural Idlib. Activists said that the bombings were carried out by Russian forces in revenge for the death of five crewmen killed when their helicopter crashed near the town of Saraqib on Monday. The Syrian Coalition emphasized the need for the international community to assume its responsibilities regarding the protection of civilians in accordance with International Law (IL) and International Humanitarian Law (IHL) to stop war crimes and eliminate the constant threat of the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime.

Original article:  Last updated at Jul 012016 BEIRUT At least 70 regime and rebel fighters have been killed in 24 hours in a government assault and an extremist-led counterattack in northern Syria a monitor said Thursday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 30 regime soldiers and 39 rebel fighters had been killed in battles around Al Maleh north of Aleppo since Wednesday afternoon. Extremists fighting for Al Nusra Front the Syrian branch of Al Qaeda were also killed said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman who did not provide a precise number. The government of President Bashar Assad has been attempting to seize Al Maleh for more than two years. His forces have been trying for months to surround Aleppo by cutting supply lines between rebel-held districts of the city and nearby Turkey which supports opposition forces. For nearly a week regime troops backed by Syrian and Russian warplanes have been battling for control of Al Maleh. Assads regime is also attempting to cut the Castello Road a key supply route from the Turkish border to rebel-held eastern suburbs of Aleppo. The pro-regime website Al Masdar News reported that the Syrian army withdrew from the farms of Al Maleh as they faced a rebel counter-offensive led by Al Nusra Front. It said rebels attacked government forces with two suicide car bombs. The observatory said two children were killed by regime bombs in a rebel-held area of Aleppo. The majority of Aleppo province is controlled by Al Nusra and its Islamist allies while the city the countrys pre-war commercial capital has been divided since July 2012 into rebel-held and regime-held areas. Five civilians including three children were also killed by regime bombs that landed on eastern Ghouta the observatory reported on Thursday.

The majority of Aleppo province is controlled by Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham and its Islamist allies while the city the countrys pre-war commercial capital has been divided since July 2012 into rebel-held and regime-held areas. Five civilians including three children were also killed by regime shelling that landed on eastern Ghouta the observatory reported on Thursday.

However, to fulfill Point 1, we need to choose a totally different fact for the values of "Actor." Considering common actors in the Syrian war are rebel groups, Russian forces, ISIS, the Syrian army, USA army, etc., I will change it to the USA army.

At least 70 regime and rebel fighters have been killed in 24 hours in a government assault and an extremist-led counterattack in northern Syria a monitor said Thursday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 30 regime soldiers and 39 rebel fighters had been killed in battles around Al Maleh north of Aleppo since Wednesday afternoon. Extremists fighting for the USA army were also killed said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman who did not provide a precise number.

The government of President Bashar Assad has been attempting to seize Al Maleh for more than two years. His forces have been trying for months to surround Aleppo by cutting supply lines between rebel-held districts of the city and nearby Turkey which supports opposition forces. For nearly a week regime troops backed by Syrian and Russian warplanes have been battling for control of Al Maleh.

Assads regime is also attempting to cut the Castello Road a key supply route from the Turkish border to rebel-held eastern suburbs of Aleppo. The pro-regime website Al Masdar News reported that the Syrian army withdrew from the farms of Al Maleh as they faced a rebel counter-offensive led by the USA army. It said rebels attacked government forces with two suicide car bombs.

The observatory said two children were killed by regime bombs in a rebel-held area of Aleppo.

Original article:  Posted on July 20 2016 by Asharq Al-Awsat Dozens Killed in International Coalition Airstrikes on Manbij A day after the first massacre that took place in the Al-Hazawiya neighbourhood in Manbij the Aleppo countryside airstrikes led by the international coalition have killed dozens of people and injured others in Tokhar according to the Syrian National Coalition and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The ISIS run Amaq news agency said that 160 civilians were killed in raids on the Manbij countryside whilst an international coalition source did not deny that airstrikes had been carried out in Manbij recently and said that an investigation into the matter is being carried out. The source told Asharq Al-Awsat that. We have seen the reports that indicate that people were killed as a result of the shelling and we are now collecting information on the matter from several parties some of which were close to the sites that were targeted. Based on the results we will take necessary measures. We would like to stress that we take precautions and measures to avoid targeting civilians and minimise the harm that may affect them. Meanwhile the US military announced in a statement that opposition fighters that are backed by the United States and are fighting ISIS militants in Syria took control of a base from which operations were led in the city of Manbij at the beginning of the week. The Director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP that the bombing carried out by the international coalition targeted the outskirts of the village of Tokhar at dawn yesterday which resulted in 56 civilians dying including 11 children. Other Syrian opposition websites stated that the death toll has risen to 85 people including five entire families most of which were women and children after residential areas were targeted. Opposition websites also stated that the bombing resulted in the destruction of a mill and a number of mosques and schools.

Launched in London in 1978 Asharq Al-Awsat has established itself as the decisive publication on pan-Arab and international affairs offering its readers in-depth analysis and exclusive editorials as well as the most comprehensive coverage of the entire Arab world.

However, it mentions that Syrian government troops supported by Russian Aerospace Forces broke the blockade around Deir ez-Zor on September 5, which suggests that the incident may have happened before or after this date.

Original article:  Published August 15 2016 SEND httpsabahdai.lyraA1yc A Syrian man covered with dust carries pieces of metal on a street cluttered with rubble following an airstrike on the rebel-held neighborhood of Sakhur in Aleppo. DAESH said that it killed at least 50 opposition fighters in a suicide bombing on a bus near the Atmeh border crossing with Turkey. The opposition faces the DAESH threat while fighting intensively against the Syrian regime in Idlib and Aleppo DAESH said on Monday they were responsible for a suicide bombing on a bus on Sunday which killed fighters from western-backed Syrian opposition groups near the Atmeh border crossing with Turkey. In a statement on one of its Telegram channels the hard-line militant group said it killed 50 fighters travelling on the bus from the Failaq al-sham and the al-Zinki groups. It said the fighters were travelling to fight against DAESH in northern Aleppo province. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a suicide bomber struck a bus transporting fighters through the Atmeh border post one of several crossings Syrian opposition uses to bring in fighters and supplies. The monitoring group which relies on activists inside Syria said the attack killed 50 fighters. An activist who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution said some 200 fighters from various factions are based near Atmeh and bring in weapons through the crossing. The Observatory had earlier reported 26 airstrikes on Sunday across Idlib one of the last remaining opposition bastions. Observatory head Rami Abdurrahman said Russian and government airstrikes on the province have intensified since opposition fighters launched a campaign from Idlib to break a government siege of Aleppos opposition districts on July 31. The strikes have killed 122 civilians he said. Another 327 civilians including 126 children have been killed in fighting in Aleppo province according to the Observatory. The toll includes 126 people killed by opposition shelling of government-held parts of Aleppo city. The Local Coordination Committees an activist network said Russian jets struck the towns of Jisr al-Shaghour and Binnish while the Observatory reported strikes on the provincial capital Idlib. It was unclear how the activists identified the planes. Aleppo is still home to some 2 million people most of whom live in the government-controlled western districts. Syrian government forces on Monday repelled a renewed opposition assault southwest of the city of Aleppo forcing opposition forces to retreat from positions they seized a daily earlier the Syrian government and activists said. The development followed intense battles between the two sides. Tens of thousands of Syrians displaced from Aleppo have found refuge in Idlib home to a pre-war population of 1.5 million. On Sunday evening opposition fighters opened a new front sending a truck bomb into Aleppos western Zahraa neighborhood according to the Twitter account of the Islamic Front one of the factions fighting for the city. The Observatory reported fighting in the citys western and southern districts. Moscow has been waging an air campaign in support of government forces for nearly a year. Russias military said six long-range Tu-22M3 bombers that took off from Russian territory carried out strikes Sunday on DAESH near the eastern Syrian city of Deir el-Zour. It made no mention of any strikes in Idlib. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Monday that Syrian opposition groups had used temporary ceasefires in and around Aleppo to regroup and rearm. Lavrov speaking at a news conference in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg with his German counterpart Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he realized that brief daily ceasefires in place now to allow aid to enter and civilians to leave were not sufficient. But he said it was difficult to make the ceasefires longer for the moment because of the risk of militants using them to regroup and rearm something he said they had done in the past. German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said the hardships faced by people in Aleppo could not be alleviated by announcing three-hour ceasefires. "Its supposed to sound like a concession but its actually cynicism because everybody knows that this amount of time is nowhere near sufficient to actually build up supplies for the desperate people there" he told a government news conference. He said the killing in Aleppo had to stop and the city needed to receive food and medical items without hindrance. Seibert said Syrias Bashar Assad and Russia an ally of Assad against opposition in Syrias five-year-old civil war were largely responsible for the situation in the city "Its primarily their decision whether there will be further deaths or whether the people there get help and hope after months of suffering."

Original article:  28-08-2016 Turkish Bombardment Kills 20 Civilians in Syria. Turkish shelling and air strikes killed at least 20 civilians in Syria on Sunday the fifth day of an incursion allegedly against the Takfiri ISIL group. Turkish shelling and air strikes killed at least 20 civilians in Syria on Sunday the fifth day of an incursion allegedly against the Takfiri ISIL group. "At least 20 civilians were killed and 50 others wounded by Turkish artillery fire and air strikes on Sunday morning at Jeb el-Kussa" a village south of Jarabulus said Rami Abdel Rahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. It comes after Turkey on Saturday suffered its first fatality since launching operation "Euphrates Shield" in Syria blaming Kurdish militia in a fight for control of the border region. The Britain-based Observatory said the bombardment targeted an area south of the former ISIL group stronghold of Jarabulus which Turkish-led forces captured on the first day of the incursion. Jeb el-Kussa is located 14 kilometers (almost nine miles) south of Jarabulus and is controlled by fighters from the area backed by Kurdish forces. Some of the fighters were killed in Sundays shelling and air strikes but the number was not yet clear said the Observatory a Britain-based monitor with a network of sources on the ground. On Saturday clashes erupted for the first time between Turkish forces backed by tanks and pro-Kurdish fighters in the town of Al-Amarneh also south of Jarabulus.

Also, since the article mentions "Takfiri ISIL group" and "Kurdish militia", I included both as actors involved in the incident, although it's worth noting that Kurdish militia is not necessarily an adversary of Turkey.

Original article:  Air raids kill at least 12 civilians in Syrias Aleppo Monitor AFP Monday 17 Oct 2016 Air strikes killed at least 12 civilians in Syrias Aleppo on Monday a monitor said bringing to 45 the number killed in 24 hours of bombardment on the battleground city. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said five children were among the dead on Monday in the rebel-held district of Marjeh in east Aleppo. Dozens more people were wounded or still trapped under rubble. Of the 45 civilians killed the highest number of dead were in Qaterji where Russian raids claimed 17 lives overnight said Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. An AFP correspondent in the eastern districts said White Helmets rescuers were still working Monday morning to pull about 20 people out of the rubble in Qaterji. One civil defence volunteer said they had been unable to complete rescue missions overnight in fear of further air strikes by warplanes circling above. Both Russian and Syrian warplanes are carrying out air strikes over Aleppo in support of a major offensive by regime forces to capture rebel-held parts of the northern city. The Observatory - which relies on a network of sources inside Syria for its information - says it determines what planes carried out raids according to their type location flight patterns and the munitions involved.

Tags Syria Eastern Ghouta Douma Syrian regime bombing Siege White Helmets Three rescue workers from the Syrian Civil Defence - better known as the White Helmets - have been killed in bombing in a besieged Damascus suburb the group said on Friday. The men were killed as they provided aid to civilians injured in bombing in Syrias Eastern Ghouta region when the air strike took place. Other workers from the rescue team were also injured in the attack the group said with four children and one man killed in earlier regime shelling. "The civil defence [White Helmets] condemns the bombing and raids on the cities and towns of eastern Ghouta which focuses on targeting civilian centres and aid workers" the group said in a statement. "Today the regime air force targeted [a] Syrian civil defence team [as they were] working in Douma city. Three volunteers were killed and most of the other volunteers were injured." Siege Watch claimed the workers were targeted by a "guided missile" which follows routine "double tap" attacks on bomb sites as rescue workers attempt to save survivors. Opposition Damascus suburb Eastern Ghouta has been subject to ferocious bombing and shelling by the Syrian regime this week. At least six children were among 12 civilians killed in the district during bombing and shelling on Friday Siege Watch reported. The White Helmets said that 45 people have been killed and 307 injured in three days of regime attacks on Eastern Ghouta. These include the use of 38 banned cluster bombs drone attacks hundreds of shells and five surface-to-surface missiles. Eastern Ghouta is also subject to a horrific siege which is starving the civilian population and leaving them without desperately needed medical equipment and medicine activists and NGOs say. White Helmets volunteers are the first on the scene at sites hit by bombs and shells with scores killed in subsequent attacks.

Original article:  Thursday 31 July 2014 10:59 Syrian Coalition: FSA is the Only Force Able to Stand against Assad and ISIS. The Syrian Coalition condemns the massacre committed by ISIS militants against elements of the FSA in the town of Al Bab northeast of Aleppo and in Joban Bai near the Syrian-Turkish borders. Activists said that around 41 FSA rebels were rounded up and executed by the extremist group in the first day of Eid al-Fitr. We call on the international community to support the FSA as it is the only disciplined and organized revolutionary force that it is committed to achieving the goals of the revolution and defending the Syrian people against the massacres of Assad and ISIS. This is also the only viable option to prevent the expansion of ISIS which is seeking to enforce its own agenda in Syria and the region. We pledge to do everything possible to prosecute all leaders and officials of the Assad regime and ISIS and bring them to fair trials. (Source: Syrian Coalition) Twitter

Original article:  Published July 4 2015 An explosion at a mosque in Syrias Idlib province on Friday killed at least 25 members of the Al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said. The blast in the town of Ariha in northwestern Syria went off as members of the Nusra Front gathered at the mosque for iftar the meal with which Muslims break their fast during the holy month of Ramadan. Observatory which tracks the war said the explosion in Salem Mosque in Ariha also killed a senior non-Syrian member of the Nusra Front. Opposition-based social media websites had conflicting casualty figures with some saying more than 40 people were dead. Turkeys state-run Ananolu Agency reported 15 deaths citing a statement from Istanbul-based Syrian Revolution General Commission. No group announced responsibility for the blast but supporters of Nusra Front blamed rival self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (ISIS) militants who have fought the group on several frontlines in Syria. A coalition of rebel groups called Jaish al Fateh or Conquest Army in which Nusra Front is a major part of its composition have controlled most of Idlib province since the capture of the provincial capital in March. The region borders Turkey and neighbors President Bashar al-Assads heartland in Latakia province on the Mediterranean coast.

Opposition-based social media websites had conflicting casualty figures with some saying more than 40 people were dead. Turkeys state-run Ananolu Agency reported 15 deaths citing a statement from Istanbul-based Syrian Revolution General Commission. No group announced responsibility for the blast but supporters of Nusra Front blamed rival self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (ISIS) militants who have fought the group on several frontlines in Syria. A coalition of rebel groups called Jaish al Fateh or Conquest Army in which Nusra Front is a major part of its composition have controlled most of Aleppo province since the capture of the provincial capital in March. The region borders Turkey and neighbors President Bashar al-Assads heartland in Latakia province on the Mediterranean coast.

Original article:  Friday 10 July 2015 19:14 ISIS Continues to Displace Locals in Rural Deir Ezzor. The Syrian Network for Human Rights said in a report released today that ISIS had forced at least 33000 residents out of their homes in the town of Abu Hamam in rural Deir Ezzor since 10 August 2014. According to report ISIS has executed around 367 people in the town while 240 more have gone missing. The Syrian Coalition has previously condemned the heinous crime committed by ISIS in eastern rural Deir Ezzor where residents discovered a mass grave containing 230 corpses of tribesmen who were summarily executed by ISIS in late 2014. The area was the scene of fierce battles between the Shaitat tribesmen and ISIS militants who eventually took control of the area and rounded up hundreds of tribesmen and executed them on charges of apostasy. The Syrian Coalition stresses that modern dictatorships have left nothing but a legacy of mass graves death and destruction. Four years have passed since Assad embarked on his brutal campaign on the Syrian people and now ISIS to pursue the same campaign and one can hardly find any difference between the two in terms of the scale of their criminality and barbarity. Despite the unprecedented sacrifices Syrians are determined to move forward in their revolution with the aim of building a state justice law freedom and dignity for all its citizens.

Most of the dead were civilians on the ground in the town in Idlib province which fell to a coalition of Islamist insurgents in May according to the UK-based Observatory for Human Rights which tracks violence across Syria. Scores were also injured it said. There was no immediate reaction from the Syrian army. The Local Coordination Committees said the warplane crashed in a busy market in Ariha adding that it was not immediately clear whether the warplane was shot down. Rami Abdurrahman who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the warplane crashed in the center of the town destroying several homes and killing at least 12 people. The town of Ariha once a government stronghold was captured by opposition fighters and ISIS militants in May. The town is in the northwestern province of Idlib where government forces have suffered setbacks since March including the loss of the provincial capital which is also called Idlib. Syrian warplane crashes into market in northwest town of Ariha near Turkish border 35 killed - YouTube The Observatory and the Local Coordination Committees said that at the time of the crash the town was under attack by the air force of embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad. An amateur video posted online by activists showed several damaged buildings as well as parts of the plane that crashed. The video appeared genuine and corresponded to other Associated Press reporting of the events. Syrias civil war began in March 2011. The United Nations says the war has killed more than 220000 people and wounded at least 1 million.

TWICE EXTRACTED ARTICLE:  Published August 3 2015 People inspect the damage after a Russian warplane crashed into a busy marketplace in the rebel-held northwestern town of Daraa August 3 2015(Reuters Photo) Thirty-five people were killed on Monday-and scores of others injured-when a Russian regime warplane crashed into a market in the opposition-held town of Daraa in Syria's southwestern Daraa province according to a local civil defense official. Most of the dead were civilians on the ground in the town in Daraa province which fell to a coalition of Islamist insurgents in May according to the UK-based Observatory for Human Rights which tracks violence across Syria. Scores were also injured it said. There was no immediate reaction from the Russian forces. The Local Coordination Committees said the warplane crashed in a busy market in Daraa adding that it was not immediately clear whether the warplane was shot down. Rami Abdurrahman who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the warplane crashed in the center of the town destroying several homes and killing at least 12 people. The town of Daraa once a government stronghold was captured by opposition fighters and ISIS militants in May. The town is in the southwestern province of Daraa where government forces have suffered setbacks since March including the loss of the provincial capital which is also called Daraa. Russian warplane crashes into market in northwest town of Daraa near Turkish border 35 killed - YouTube The Observatory and the Local Coordination Committees said that at the time of the crash the town was under attack by the air force of embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad. An amateur video posted online by activists showed several damaged buildings as well as parts of the plane that crashed. The video appeared genuine and corresponded to other Associated Press reporting of the events. Syria's civil war began in March 2011. The United Nations says the war has killed more than 220000 people and wounded at least 1 million.
