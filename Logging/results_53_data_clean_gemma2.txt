Food production in Syria at all-time low Food production has dropped to an all-time low in Syria where civilians are struggling through their sixth winter in a war zone UN agencies said on Tuesday. Many farmers have had to abandon their land unable to afford the soaring cost of seeds fertilizers and tractor fuel the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme said. Wheat output - vital for making flat loaves of bread a staple of the Syrian diet - dropped from an average 3.4 million metric tonnes harvested before the war began in 2011 to 1.5 million this year they said in a joint statement. Play Video The area planted for cereals in the 2015-16 cropping season is the smallest ever they added citing field visits and surveys that also showed record low production of barley. Food production in Syria has hit a record low due to fighting and insecurity but also weather conditions World Food Programme spokeswoman Bettina Luescher told a news briefing in Geneva. Food shortages are particularly worrying in east Aleppo the rebel-held part of the city besieged by government forces where the UN says 250000-275000 civilians still live. The last food rations provided by the UN have been given out (in east Aleppo). It is very hard to say how people will be coping there. Of course it is a very different situation in the capital where food is available at the markets and people can buy things Luescher said. Before the war Syria was an exporter of livestock. Now herds and flocks have shrunk there are 30 percent fewer cattle 40 percent fewer sheep and goats and a staggering 60 percent less poultry which of course is the most affordable source of animal protein Luescher said. More than 7 million people in Syria are classified as food insecure meaning they are not always sure where their next meal is coming from she added. The World Food Programme is distributing rations to more than 4 million people in Syria each month.

Fridas fighting came after renewed tensions between the two sides in Kurdish-dominated areas to the north and east of Syria. This is not the first time that Islamists linked to Al-Qaeda and Kurdish militants have fought since the Syrian crisis erupted in 2011. Rebel-on-rebel violence has been frequent in areas along the Turkish border and last month witnessed heavy clashes in the oil-rich city of Ras Al-Ayn in northeastern Syria.

Abdul Jabbar Akidi a member of the FSA military council announcing that the FSA has sent reinforcement to Islamists. This cannot be tolerated. If it is necessary we will wipe out the PKK he said referring to the Kurdistan Workers Party. Viewed as the largest Kurdish political and military formation in Syria the Democratic Union Party (PYD) dismissed Akidis statement as unjustified. Speaking exclusively to Asharq Al-Awsat PYD spokesman Nawaf Khalil said that reasons for Akidis calls to fight Kurds are unknown and that the PKK has clearly announced that the Syrian regime and its supporters have lost legitimacy. This attack is meant to be against the entire Kurdish region on the pretext of fighting the PKK Khalil said stressing that Kurds will fight those who attack them. The PYD the Syrian franchise of the Turkish PKK is believed to stand as the largest political and military formation in Syria and has assumed control over the Kurdish-dominated areas to the east and north of Syria since July 2012 setting up checkpoints and running public affairs. Khalil reaffirmed to Asharq Al-Awsat the PYDs despire to topple the regime as well as its opposition to the Al-Qaeda-linked rebel groups such as the Al-Nusra Front. We did not want to go into battles with the Islamists particularly after the agreement we signed with them but today they are laying siege to us in addition to the siege laid by the Syrian regime on the one hand and Turkey along the borders on the other the PYD spokesman said. He added The stances of the opposition and the FSA serve the interests of the dictatorial regime.

The attack on the town of Khan Sheikhun killed at least 58 civilians and saw dozens suffering respiratory problems and symptoms including vomiting fainting and foaming at the mouth the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said. Syrias opposition blamed President Bashar Assads forces saying the attack cast doubt on the future of peace talks. The army denied any involvement however issuing a statement blaming "terrorist groups" for using "chemical and toxic substances". At least 11 children were among the dead the observatory said and an AFP correspondent in Khan Sheikhun saw many attached to respirators. If confirmed it would be one of the worst chemical attacks since the start of Syrias civil war six years ago. The incident brought swift international condemnation with the United States France and Britain all pointing the finger at Assad. US blames Damascus The White House condemned what it said was a "reprehensible" attack carried out by Assads forces. Spokesman Sean Spicer said President Donald Trump had been briefed extensively on the incident adding that the US was "confident in its assessment" that Damascus was to blame. Spicer also suggested it was in the "best interest" of Syrians for Assad not to lead the country. UN envoy Staffan de Mistura said the attack was believed to be chemical and launched from the air adding that there should be a "clear identification of responsibilities and accountability". The observatory said the attack on a residential part of Khan Sheikhun came early on Tuesday morning when a warplane carried out strikes that released "toxic gas". As well as those killed at least 160 people were injured it said and many were dying even after arriving at medical facilities. The monitor could not confirm the nature of the gas but said the attack was likely carried out by government warplanes. We heard strikes this morning... We ran inside the houses and saw whole families just dead in their beds. Children women old people dead in the streets resident Abu Mustafa said. Russias military which has been fighting in support of Assads government since September 2015 denied carrying out any strikes near the town. Hours after the initial attack air strikes also hit a hospital in the town where doctors were treating victims the AFP correspondent said bringing down rubble on top of medics as they worked. He saw a young girl a woman and two elderly people dead at a hospital. A father carried his dead little girl her lips blueish and her dark curls visible wrapped in a sheet. As doctors worked a warplane circled overhead striking first near the facility and then hitting it twice inflicting severe damage and prompting nearly a dozen medical staff to flee. Speaking to AFP medic Hazem Shehwan said victims were suffering from symptoms including pinpoint pupils convulsions foaming at the mouth and rapid pulses. Army denial Khan Sheikhun is in Idlib province which is largely controlled by an alliance of rebels including former Al Qaeda affiliate Fateh Al Sham Front. The province is regularly targeted in government and Russian air strikes and has also been hit by the US-led coalition fighting Daesh group usually targeting extremists. Syrias leading opposition group the National Coalition blamed Assad for the attack and demanded the UN open an immediate investigation and hold those responsible to account. Failure to do so will be understood as a message of blessing to the regime for its actions it said. Damascus officially joined the Chemical Weapons Convention and turned over its declared chemical arsenal in 2013 as part of a deal to avert US military action. That agreement came after hundreds of people up to 1429 according to a US intelligence report were killed in chemical weapons strikes allegedly carried out by government troops east and southwest of Damascus. But there have been repeated allegations of chemical weapons use since with a UN-led investigation pointing the finger at the regime for at least three chlorine attacks in 2014 and 2015. The army again denied using chemical weapons on Tuesday insisting it has never used them any time anywhere and will not do so in the future. The global chemical arms watchdog said it was seriously concerned by reports of the attack. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it was gathering and analysing information from all available sources. The UNs Commission of Inquiry for Syria said it had begun investigating the alleged use of chemical weapons. Peace talks doubts More than 320000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests. Successive rounds of peace talks including a UN-sponsored meeting in Geneva last week have failed to produce a political breakthrough. Tuesdays attack cast new doubt on the peace process said the oppositions chief negotiator Mohamad Sabra. If the United Nations cannot deter the regime from carrying out such crimes how can it achieve a process that leads to political transition in Syria? he told AFP. A senior Syrian security source told AFP that opposition forces were trying to achieve in the media what they could not achieve on the ground by spreading images from the alleged attack site. The UN Security Council is to hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss the attack following calls from France and Britain. Ive seen the reports about the use of sarin and as far as I know they have not been confirmed the British ambassador to the UN Matthew Rycroft said. This is clearly a war crime Rycroft told reporters.

It said the fighters were travelling to fight against DAESH in northern Aleppo province.

Article:  19 Apr 2017 The blast happened as the regime and opposition resumed population exchanges four days after a deadly attack on a convoy of evacuees forced both sides to suspend the deal. A boy who was injured during a bomb blast on a crowded Syrian bus convoy outside Aleppo on Saturday sits inside a tent connected to Bab al-Hawa hospital near the Syrian-Turkish border Syria April 18 2017 (File photo) (TRT World and Agencies) A bomb killed six people and wounded more than 30 in Syrias second city Aleppo on Wednesday the Assad regimes official television channel reported. The blast hit the southwestern neighbourhood of Salaheddin which was on the front line between opposition and regime-held sectors before Bashar al Assads forces retook full control of the city in December. The attack took place as evacuations of civilians from conflict zones resumed after a four-day pause. About 45 buses carrying 3000 people left the opposition-besieged al-Foua and Kefraya towns of the northwestern Idlib province for regime-controlled Aleppo. Meanwhile a convoy of 11 buses left regime-besieged al-Zabadani near the capital Damascus for opposition-controlled territory a military media unit linked to the pro-regime Hezbollah group said. "The area of Zabadani is empty of militants after the last batch of them left this morning" the pro-regime Sham FM radio reported citing a senior regime official in Zabadani. Three buses on Wednesday also carried people who were injured in a convoy attack as they were being transferred from al-Foua and Kefraya on Saturday as well as the remains of those who had died in the attack the Hezbollah military media unit said. Saturdays convoy attack killed 126 people including more than 60 children the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The convoy was carrying at least 5000 people including civilians and several hundred pro-regime fighters who were granted safe passage out of the two towns. The attack forced a population exchange deal brokered by regime ally Iran and opposition backer Qatar to be halted. Under the deal more than 30000 people will be evacuated from four Syrian towns in two stages. Source TRTWorld and agencies

Article:  A devastating bomb blast in Aleppo has left six people dead and over 30 injured. The attack occurred in the southwestern neighborhood of Salaheddin, a former front-line area between opposition and regime-held sectors before Bashar al-Assad's forces regained control of the city.

Evacuations of civilians from conflict zones have resumed after a four-day pause. Convoy buses carrying thousands of people left besieged towns for regime-controlled areas, but a previous day's convoy attack had already claimed 126 lives, including over 60 children. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the convoy was carrying at least 5000 people.

The previous attack forced a population exchange deal brokered by Iran and Qatar to be halted. As evacuations resume, residents of besieged towns remain in a precarious situation, vulnerable to further attacks.

Article:  6 Oct 2016 At least 29 people were killed and dozens wounded in a suicide bombing that targeted a Syria-Turkey border crossing on Thursday. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights the casualties included fighters from the Free Syrian Army (FSA) the Turkish-backed force which has played a pivotal role in the fight against DAESH along the Syria-Turkey border. The attack took place on the Syrian side of the Atmeh crossing west of Aleppo during a change of guard among the FSA the Observatory said. According to Anadolu Agency the blast targeted the Atmeh refugee camp. In an online statement DAESH has claimed responsibilty for the attack. Witnesses said most of the fighters killed in the attack were from the Failaq al-Sham. The group has been fighting alongside other Turkish-backed factions in Ankaras offensive dubbed "Euphrates Shield" against DAESH. (TRT World and Agencies) The fighters use the Atmeh crossing to move between the Syrian province of Idlib through Turkey to the areas where anti-DAESH operations are taking place the Observatory said. Residents said they also use it to evacuate wounded fighters. Among the dead from the Atmeh blast were the head of the top civil judicial body in rebel-held eastern Aleppo Sheikh Khaled al-Sayyed and a judge who worked with him a witness and a rebel official said. Idlib province where Atmeh is located is a bastion of the opposition groups fighting Bashar al-Assads regime. The multi-sided civil war has raged on for more than five years. Opposition fighters have been targeted at the crossing before. DAESH claimed responsibility for a mid-August suicide attack there that killed at least 32. The fighters killed on Thursday were also among those participating in Euphrates Shield. Ankara began the unprecedented cross-border operation on August 24 saying it was targeting both DAESH and the YPG which Turkey considers a terrorist group. The operation has so far captured the DAESH stronghold of Jarablus and is pushing towards the towns of Dabiq and Al-Bab.

Article:  Published April 29 2017 At least four people were killed and 11 others were injured in airstrikes reportedly carried out by the Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria. A mosque was also destroyed by regime airstrikes north of Hama in the west-central region of the country local civil defense sources said Friday. A civil defense official in Idlib Leys el-Faris told Anadolu Agency four civilians were killed and seven others injured in an airstrike which hit the Sermin district. According to Faris a number of residential areas were destroyed in the attack. The Abu Ubaidah Ibn al-Jarrah mosque north of Hama city in Kafr Zeita was also destroyed by Russian airstrikes. "The regime is intensively attacking rural areas in Idlib and Hama with its allies" Faris said. Videos and images of the destroyed mosque have been circulating online. Speaking to Anadolu Agency Yusuf el-Bustani a local activist said regime forces were attacking the opposition-controlled Qaboun neighborhood of the capital Damascus. Bustani said four civilians had been injured in the attack. He added local people had difficulties in meeting basic needs due to regime forces attack in East Ghouta. Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests with unexpected ferocity. Several rounds of peace talks - in Geneva and the Kazakh capital Astana - have so far failed to end the conflict in which hundreds of thousands of Syrian civilians are believed to have been killed to date. The namesake of the destroyed mosque Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah was one of the companions of the prophet Muhammad and converted to Islam in 611. Like many of the early Muslims of Mecca Abu Ubaidah experienced hardships because of his faith and migrated to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) with a delegation at Muhammads suggestion. Abu Ubaidah joined Muhammad when the prophet migrated from Mecca to Medina in 622. During his life he was a military commander in the Muslim-Quraysh Wars and during the Rashidun conquest of the Levant. He died of the plague in 639 and his tomb can be found in modern day Jordan.

Article:  Wednesday 16 November 2016 Syrian Russian jets pound rebel areas. Air strikes pounded neighbourhoods around a childrens hospital and a blood bank in rebel-held eastern Aleppo on Wednesday in a second day of renewed bombing that has killed at least 32 people a war monitor medics and emergency workers said. Russian military planes were seen all night until morning in several regions of Idlib in northwestern Syria said Rami Abdel Rahman head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The regime air force bombed eastern sectors of Aleppo Syrias divided second city Abdel Rahman told AFP. The air raids formed part of a wider military escalation by the Syrian government and allies including Russia which fired coordinated volleys of missiles at rebels on Tuesday and for the first time used its only aircraft carrier. The Syrian Observatory said the air strikes on eastern Aleppo on Wednesday alone killed at least 21 people including five children and an emergency worker. They were carried out by either Russian or Syrian warplanes it said. The Observatory said districts struck included al-Shaar al-Sukkari al-Sakhour and Karam al-Beik. Air raids also continued in the countryside west of Aleppo from which rebels have launched assaults on government-held areas. An attack on the village of Batbo killed at least 19 people including three children the Observatory said. Moscow has denied reports that its jets have hit Aleppo in the renewed wave of bombardment and said it was sticking to a moratorium on air strikes in the city. Tuesdays bombing run on eastern Aleppo appeared to mark the end of a pause inside the city declared by Russia on Oct. 18 which Syrias military had also largely observed. The Observatory and residents said the citys east was hit by rocket fired from jets barrel bombs dropped from helicopters and artillery from government forces. The helicopters wont stop for a single moment Bebars Mishal a civil defence worker in rebel-held Aleppo told Reuters. Right now the bombing wont let up. Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu spoke of a major operation which saw the first missions carried out by warplanes taking off from the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier that arrived off Syria last week. The Kremlin said on Wednesday that a moratorium on Russian air strikes against targets in Aleppo remained in place for the time being. In this Oct. 11 2016 file photo provided by the Syrian Civil Defense group known as the White Helmets residents sit amongst rubble in rebel-held eastern Aleppo Syria. (AP) The offensive drew strong condemnation from the United States which said it had received reports of hospitals and clinics being bombed. Once Syrias economic powerhouse Aleppo has been ravaged by the war that has killed more than 300000 people across the country since it started in March 2011 with anti-government protests. UN condemns Syrian attacks in Aleppo Meanwhile a UN committee has approved a resolution strongly condemning the recent escalation of attacks in Aleppo and continuing violence by the Syrian government against its own people. The General Assemblys human rights committee voted 116-15 with 49 abstentions in favor of the draft resolution on Tuesday. It is virtually certain to be adopted when the assembly votes next month. An injured child waits after receiving treatment at the University hospital in a government-held neighbourhood on November 3 2016 following reported rebel fire on government-held parts of the northern city of Aleppo. (AFP) The draft resolution demands that Syrian authorities immediately put an end to all indiscriminate attacks including those involving the use of terror tactics air strikes barrel and vacuum bombs incendiary weapons chemical weapons and heavy artillery. It deplores and condemns in the strongest terms widespread human rights violations by the Syrian government. The draft calls for a cease-fire by all parties saying this is essential to achieve a political solution. Food production in Syria at all-time low Food production has dropped to an all-time low in Syria where civilians are struggling through their sixth winter in a war zone UN agencies said on Tuesday. Many farmers have had to abandon their land unable to afford the soaring cost of seeds fertilizers and tractor fuel the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme said. Wheat output - vital for making flat loaves of bread a staple of the Syrian diet - dropped from an average 3.4 million metric tonnes harvested before the war began in 2011 to 1.5 million this year they said in a joint statement. Play Video The area planted for cereals in the 2015-16 cropping season is the smallest ever they added citing field visits and surveys that also showed record low production of barley. Food production in Syria has hit a record low due to fighting and insecurity but also weather conditions World Food Programme spokeswoman Bettina Luescher told a news briefing in Geneva. Food shortages are particularly worrying in east Aleppo the rebel-held part of the city besieged by government forces where the UN says 250000-275000 civilians still live. The last food rations provided by the UN have been given out (in east Aleppo). It is very hard to say how people will be coping there. Of course it is a very different situation in the capital where food is available at the markets and people can buy things Luescher said. Before the war Syria was an exporter of livestock. Now herds and flocks have shrunk there are 30 percent fewer cattle 40 percent fewer sheep and goats and a staggering 60 percent less poultry which of course is the most affordable source of animal protein Luescher said. More than 7 million people in Syria are classified as food insecure meaning they are not always sure where their next meal is coming from she added. The World Food Programme is distributing rations to more than 4 million people in Syria each month. (With AP Reuters and AFP) Last Update: Wednesday 16 November 2016 KSA 20:36 - GMT 17:36 12480

Article:  Date of publication 5 June 2016 Air strikes by Syrian regime war planes in Aleppo on Sunday have killed around 32 civilians in a rebel-held district a human rights monitor said. Tags Aleppo Syria human rights barrel bombs Syria war air raids Dozens of Syrian regime air strikes on Aleppo killed at least 16 civilians on Sunday a monitor said with barrel bombs causing huge damage to one rebel-held district. Local activists put the death toll higher saying that around 32 have been killed. The crude unguided explosive devices hit the Qaterji neighbourhood where an AFP photographer saw a street strewn with rubble as residents ran for safety while a rescuer rushed a bloodied child into an ambulance. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said nine civilians were killed in Qaterji and two others - including a child - died in the Mayssar neighbourhood of the northern city. Another five civilians were killed in two other districts and on the citys outskirts. In Qaterji a man stood in the middle of a road surrounded by debris and shouting angrily "There are only civilians here there are no rebels!" Further down the street two women and two children scrambled for safety past the mangled iron shutters of shops and buildings badly damaged by the barrel bomb the AFP photographer said. The rescuer his hair covered in white dust carried a child with a blood-covered face to an ambulance in which another wounded child already lay. A truce agreed by Russia and the United States in February has been violated nearly continuously around Aleppo where the regime and rebel groups have fought for control since 2012. Around 200000 people lived in rebel-held eastern parts of Aleppo and the only route out of those areas has been cut following fierce fighting that erupted on Thursday. More than 300 civilians have been killed in Aleppo since April. Analysts estimate that around 400000 people have been killed and millions displaced since Syrias war started in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests. Read Also

Article:  Air strikes by Syrian regime war planes caused devastating loss of life and widespread destruction in Aleppo. The attacks targeted multiple districts, including residential areas where innocent residents had taken refuge. In one rebel-held neighborhood, Qaterji, residents described scenes of utter chaos as barrel bombs ripped through the streets, killing dozens.

Local activists reported that nine civilians were killed in Qaterji and two others, including a child, died in another part of the city. The death toll is expected to rise further as more information becomes available about the scale of the devastation. The attacks are widely seen as a flagrant disregard for international law and a clear breach of the truce agreed by Russia and the United States in February.

The city of Aleppo has been ravaged by war since 2012, with over 200,000 people living in rebel-held eastern areas where the only exit route has been cut off. More than 300 civilians have been killed in the city since April alone. The brutal repression of anti-government protests that started in 2011 has resulted in an estimated 400,000 deaths and millions displaced across Syria.

Article:  Date of publication 6 June 2016 At least 17 civilians have been killed by a suspected Russian air raid in the market in the town of al-Asharah in the Deir Az-Zour province. Tags Syria air strike SOHR ISIS Deir az-Zour al-Asharah civilians Ramadan. Seventeen civilians including eight children were killed in air raids on a market in eastern Syria on Monday the first day of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights [SOHR] said the strikes on al-Asharah a town held by the Islamic State group [IS] in Deir Az-Zour province. "The market was overcrowded on Monday because people were shopping for Ramadan" SOHR chief Rami Abdel Rahman said in a televised interview. He said many of those killed were from the same family and that the death toll was likely to rise because of the serious condition of some of the wounded. Local activist Amir al-Huwaidi told The New Arab that the attack was most likely carried out by Russian warplanes. Heavy air raids hit IS-held areas in and outside the divided city of Deir Az-Zour from early on Monday. IS controls more than 60 percent of the city besieging an estimated 200000 people there. The Islamic militant group also controls most of the surrounding oil-rich province by the same name. The SOHR relies on a network of sources inside Syria to gather its information on the five-year conflict which has killed more than 280000 people and displaced millions. It says it determines whether strikes were carried out by Syrian Russian or US-led coalition aircraft based on the location of the raids flight patterns and the types of planes and munitions involved. Russia began carrying out strikes in Syria in September 2015 one year after the United States began its air campaign there. Regime air raids killed at least 15 civilians in the IS-held area of Boleel outside Deir az-Zour city on Friday. Read Also

Article:  Seven dead 20 wounded in central Damascus blast Monitor AFP Sunday 1 Feb 2015 At least seven people were killed and 20 wounded when a blast ripped through a bus in a central district of the Syrian capital on Sunday a monitoring group said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it was not immediately clear what had caused the blast in the Souq al-Hamadiyeh neighbourhood of Damascus. The explosion was also reported by Syrian state media with the official SANA news agency saying at least four people had been killed and 19 wounded. Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said the bus was reportedly carrying Shiite Muslim pilgrims visiting religious sites in the capital. Parts of Damascus have remained relatively unscathed by the fighting raging in much of Syria since an uprising erupted in March 2011. But rebels regularly fire rockets into the capital from rear bases in the surrounding countryside and the city has also been hit by bombings. More than 200000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict started and around half of the countrys population has been displaced.

Article:  Saturday 23 April 2016 18:20 Abdah: Assads Bombing of Aleppo Encouraged by International Communitys Bias. President of the Syrian Coalition Anas al-Abdah said that the international communitys soft stance in dealing with Assad who continues to commit massacres against civilians in Syria is seen by him as a license to carry on with his crimes against the Syrian people. Abdah also said that this complete inaction towards Assads atrocities represents a bias in favor of a serial killer and a war criminal. At least 13 civilians mostly women and children were killed and over 30 others were wounded on Saturday when regime forces bombed a popular market in the District of Douma in Rural Damascus with heavy artillery. The Assad regimes air force continues to relentlessly hit residential areas in the Aleppo neighborhoods of Tariq al-Bab Bustan al-Qasr Salahaddin al-Mashhad al-Amiriyah Baidin al-Jandoul and Bani Zeid. No figure of the casualties resulted has been released by civil defense teams as they are still recovering victims from under the rubble. Activists said that at least 20 civilians including children were killed and many more wounded in intensifying aerial bombing of Aleppo on Friday by regime and Russian forces. Three more civilians were killed and around 15 others were injured on Friday evening in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime. (Source: Syrian Coalition) Twitter

Article:  The Syrian Coalition has accused the international community of bias in its handling of President Assad's regime. According to Anas al-Abdah, the president of the Syrian Coalition, this soft stance is encouraging Assad to continue committing atrocities against civilians in Syria. The accusations come as at least 13 civilians, mostly women and children, were killed and over 30 others were wounded in a brutal barrel bomb attack by regime forces in Douma in Rural Damascus on Saturday. In addition, activists have reported that intensifying aerial bombings by regime and Russian forces in various neighborhoods of Aleppo resulted in the deaths of at least 20 civilians, including children, and many more were injured due to torture and ill-treatment at the hands of regime forces.

Article:  Car bomb in Syrias Homs kills 10 Governor AFP Sunday 25 May 2014 "Ten people were killed and 22 wounded in a car bomb attack on a collective taxi stand in Zahraa" a district inhabited by Alawites the Shiite sect of President Bashar al-Assad said Talal al-Barazi. Barazi had earlier reported a toll of eight while the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights gave a death toll of 12. A second car bomb exploded in another district of the city wounding three people but without causing more deaths said Barazi. Homs has seen some of the worst violence in Syrias more than three-year-old civil war. For almost two years anti-regime fighters and local residents were trapped in a suffocating army siege of the Old City in the heart of Homs. They were evacuated earlier this month under an unprecedented deal involving a major rebel coalition and Iran a strong backer of the regime. The end of the Old City siege brought it back under regime control leaving only the Waer district in northwest Homs in rebel hands. The Observatory and activists say a deal is being negotiated for a truce in Waer which is home to hundreds of thousands of civilians.

Article:  A devastating building collapse in Syria's Homs city has resulted in a significant loss of life and injury. The incident occurred in the Zahraa district, which is predominantly inhabited by Alawites, a Shia sect to which President Bashar al-Assad belongs. In separate incidents, two car bombs exploded in different districts of the city, but it remains unclear if these events are connected to the building collapse. Homs has been one of the worst-hit cities in Syria's ongoing civil war.

Article:  Rebel fire kills 3 Aleppo schoolchildren state media AFP Thursday 27 Oct 2016 At least three children were killed and 14 injured in a rebel rocket attack on a school in the government-held west of Aleppo city on Thursday Syrian state media said. A monitoring group said a child was also among at least eight people killed in government shelling on the rebel-held town of Douma outside Damascus. "Three children were killed and 14 students were injured in a terrorist rocket attack on the national school in the Shahba neighbourhood of Aleppo" state news agency SANA reported. The neighbourhood is in the western outskirts of the city which has been roughly divided since mid-2012 when rebels seized its eastern half. Rebels regularly fire crude homemade rockets into the west of the city often killing civilians. Government forces backed by ally Russia have waged an aerial and ground assault since late September to recapture eastern Aleppo killing hundreds of civilians and destroying infrastructure including hospitals. The deaths came a day after the UN childrens agency UNICEF said 22 children had been killed along with six teachers in air strikes on a school in rebel-held Idlib province. The strikes carried out by either Russian or Syrian warplanes according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights hit the village of Hass prompting outrage from UNICEF director Anthony Lake. "This is a tragedy. It is an outrage. And if deliberate it is a war crime" he said adding that the school complex had been hit repeatedly. Outside Damascus meanwhile at least eight people were killed on Thursday in government shelling on Douma in the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta region the British-based Observatory said. Douma is regularly targeted by government fire and in recent months regime forces have waged an offensive in the area which has also been under siege since 2013. More than 300000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests.

Article:  A devastating event occurred on Thursday, October 27, 2016, in Douma, a rebel-held area outside Damascus. At least eight people, including a child, were killed due to rocket fire from government forces. This tragedy took place amidst ongoing conflict between government forces and rebels.

Rebel attacks had already claimed victims earlier that day in the government-held west of Aleppo city. Three children were killed and 14 students injured in a rocket attack on a school in the Shahba neighborhood. These attacks have become all too common, with crude homemade rockets fired into the western part of the city often killing civilians.

The UN children's agency, UNICEF, had spoken out against a similar tragedy just a day earlier. Twenty-two children and six teachers were killed in air strikes on a school in Idlib province, prompting outrage from UNICEF director Anthony Lake. He called it "a tragedy... an outrage... and if deliberate, a war crime."

These events are part of the larger conflict that has ravaged Syria since anti-government protests began in March 2011. More than 300,000 people have lost their lives in this brutal struggle.

Article:  Posted on April 2 2017 by Youssef Diab MSF Syrian Regime Used Chemical Weapons in Hama Beirut Doctors Without Borders (MSF) accused the Syrian regime and its allies of using chemical weapons in their bombardment of the Hama governorate on March 25. MSF reported that the regime targeted Latamneh hospital in the northern Hama governorate killing two people and causing severe respiratory symptoms among patients and staff. The hospitals orthopedic surgeon Dr. Darwish was one of two people killed. Thirteen people were transferred to other facilities for treatment. It reported that at around 600 pm on March 25 the Latamneh hospital was targeted by a bomb dropped by a helicopter which hit the entrance of the building. The organization relied in its report on information from the hospital staff that proved that chemical weapons were used. Patients and staff reported suffering severe respiratory symptoms and burning of mucous membranessymptoms consistent with an attack using chemicals. The hospital went out of service for three days due to the attack after which the emergency room reopened. The hospital is located a few miles from the frontlines and provides medical care for around 8000 people. Prior to the attacks the hospital had an emergency room and inpatient department and provided general and orthopedic surgery. Massimiliano Rebaudengo MSFs head of mission in northern Syria said that the loss of Dr. Darwish leaves just two orthopedic surgeons for a population of around 120000. Bombing hospitals although banned by International Humanitarian Law remains a common practice in Syria and health services are severely affected by these repeated attacks he added. Over the past year MSF has received reports of at least 71 attacks on 32 different health facilities which it runs or supports in Syria. On February 22 an MSF-supported health facility in Idlib governorate was hit by rockets killing six and wounding 33 others. Meanwhile Al-Nasr Army announced that the Hama battle will continue and the retreat of rebels from several locations does not mean they have been defeated. Battles continued between the regime forces and opposition factions on all fronts in Hama coinciding with dozens of air raids by Russian and Syrian war planes. Al-Nasr Army military spokesperson Lieutenant Iyad al-Homsi said The criminal gangs resorted to chemical weapons when they were no longer able to defeat us in the battlefield. Speaking to Asharq Al-Awsat he added Those who witness the number of deaths of regime forces and its affiliated militias will realize that victory is ours. We have proven to the world that after six years of killing destruction and displacement that our revolution will continue. Head of the Hama Media center Abu Yazan al-Noiami said that the retreat of rebel forces and the consequent advances of the regime over the past two days were caused by the regimes use of chemical gases. He added that both the regime and Iranian forces are resorting to media blackouts to hide the very high figures of their losses. He stressed Hundreds of Iranian militants were killed and over 30 tanks personnel vehicles and cannons were destroyed in this battle. In a new development 17 armed factions in coastal regions Aleppo Hama and Idlib announced that they agreed to form a comprehensive military operations room aimed at fighting the Syrian regime and restoring stability in the region. Opposition website al-Durrar al-Shamiyyah reported an informed source as saying that factions of al-Jabha al-Shamiyyah al-Sham Legion Mujahideen Army al-Nasr Army Idlib Army Freedom Brigade the Middle Company and many others are part of this operations room. According to the source Colonel Fadlullah Naji of the al-Sham Legion will head the room adding that during the last month and a half the troops had been meeting to agree on all details which he did not disclose. He said that the final meeting will be held in the coming few days to present the framework of the room after which it will be officially announced. Youssef Diab Launched in London

Article:  Posted on August 3 2013 by Nazeer Rida At least 12 Islamist fighters were killed in clashes with Kurdish militants in the Syrian city of Hasaka early Friday the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said. Clashes erupted on Friday at midnight between fighters from the Peoples Protection Units (YPG) on the one hand and fighters from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and the Al-Nusra Front on the other hand the SOHR announced. Fridas fighting came after renewed tensions between the two sides in Kurdish-dominated areas to the north and east of Syria. This is not the first time that Islamists linked to Al-Qaeda and Kurdish militants have fought since the Syrian crisis erupted in 2011. Rebel-on-rebel violence has been frequent in areas along the Turkish border and last month witnessed heavy clashes in the oil-rich city of Ras Al-Ayn in northeastern Syria. The ArabKurdish crisis appears to include the Free Syrian Army (FSA). A video posted on the internet showed Col. Abdul Jabbar Akidi a member of the FSA military council announcing that the FSA has sent reinforcement to Islamists. This cannot be tolerated. If it is necessary we will wipe out the PKK he said referring to the Kurdistan Workers Party. Viewed as the largest Kurdish political and military formation in Syria the Democratic Union Party (PYD) dismissed Akidis statement as unjustified. Speaking exclusively to Asharq Al-Awsat PYD spokesman Nawaf Khalil said that reasons for Akidis calls to fight Kurds are unknown and that the PKK has clearly announced that the Syrian regime and its supporters have lost legitimacy. This attack is meant to be against the entire Kurdish region on the pretext of fighting the PKK Khalil said stressing that Kurds will fight those who attack them. The PYD the Syrian franchise of the Turkish PKK is believed to stand as the largest political and military formation in Syria and has assumed control over the Kurdish-dominated areas to the east and north of Syria since July 2012 setting up checkpoints and running public affairs. Khalil reaffirmed to Asharq Al-Awsat the PYDs despire to topple the regime as well as its opposition to the Al-Qaeda-linked rebel groups such as the Al-Nusra Front. We did not want to go into battles with the Islamists particularly after the agreement we signed with them but today they are laying siege to us in addition to the siege laid by the Syrian regime on the one hand and Turkey along the borders on the other the PYD spokesman said. He added The stances of the opposition and the FSA serve the interests of the dictatorial regime. They should have looked for a formula to deal cooperate and even coordinate on the ground with the Kurdish side in the face of the regimes aggression. We work to topple the regime and coordinate with all sides but we will not accept the Islamists the regime army or the FSA entering our area. In other news the UN said it would probe reports opposition fighters committed a massacre against troops loyal to Assad in Khan Al-Assal after seizing the strategic town from the regime last week UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said in a statement. After examining videos documenting the atrocities committed by rebels Pillay said These images if verified suggest that executions were committed in Khan Al-Assal calling for a thorough independent investigation to establish whether war crimes have been committed. She also warned that all sides in Syria should not think they are immune from prosecution. Nazeer Rida

Article:  Clashes between Islamist and Kurdish forces have been escalating in the Syrian city of Hasaka. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that fighting broke out on Friday at midnight between fighters from the Peoples Protection Units (YPG) and those affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and Al-Nusra Front. This is not the first time Islamist and Kurdish forces have clashed since the Syrian crisis began in 2011.

The Arab-Kurdish conflict appears to be escalating, with the Free Syrian Army (FSA) sending reinforcements to fight against Kurdish militants. The FSA has announced its intention to wipe out the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which is seen as the largest Kurdish political and military formation in Syria. However, the Democratic Union Party (PYD), a PYD spokesman said that this attack is meant to be against the entire Kurdish region on the pretext of fighting the PKK.

The PYD has dismissed the FSA's statement as unjustified, saying that reasons for their calls to fight Kurds are unknown. The PYD has also reaffirmed its desire to topple the regime and coordinate with all sides, but will not accept the Islamists, the regime army, or the FSA entering their area.

In other news, the UN has announced an investigation into reports of a massacre against troops loyal to Assad in Khan Al-Assal. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said that the images suggest executions were committed and called for a thorough independent investigation to establish whether war crimes have been committed.

Article:  29 Jul 2016 The US-led coalition strikes came a day after the coalition opened a formal investigation to determine whether its air strikes last week near Manbij claimed more than 100 civilians including children. A picture taken on July 29 2016 shows a close up view of Karaj al-Hajz corridor (C) a passage in rebel-held Aleppo leading towards the Syrian government controlled area of Masharqa neighbourhood. (TRT World and Agencies) At least 15 civilians were killed and many wounded in fresh air strikes by US-led coalition in Syria on Thursday morning. These civilians were targeted in the coalition jets bombardment in the town of Ghandoura said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. US Central Command which oversees US military operations in the Middle East said it had "initiated an assessment following internal operational reporting that a strike today near Manbij Syria may have resulted in civilian casualties." The strikes came a day after the coalition opened a formal investigation to determine whether its air strikes last week near Manbij claimed more than 100 civilian lives including children. US-led coalition continue to target civilians in Syria (Reuters) Around 600 Syrians including 136 children have been killed in coalition air strikes since September 2014 according to an Observatory toll. More than 520 US airstrikes since 21 May have killed between 229 and 425 civilians overall. After examining "internal and external information" the coalition determined that there was sufficient credible evidence of civilian victims to open a formal inquiry said spokesman Colonel Chris Garver on Wednesday. The main Syrian opposition group had urged the US-led coalition to suspend its bombardments following the strikes. Amnesty International has also called on the coalition to redouble its efforts to prevent civilian deaths and to investigate possible violations of international humanitarian law.

Article:  A US-led coalition's airstrikes in Syria have resulted in a devastating loss of civilian life. At least 15 people, including children, were killed in a recent wave of strikes, just a day after an investigation was launched into previous attacks near Manbij that allegedly claimed over 100 lives.

The US Central Command has initiated an assessment of their operations in Syria, citing reports of possible civilian casualties. This comes as no surprise given the high number of deaths attributed to coalition airstrikes since 2014, with over 600 people, including 136 children, killed.

The Syrian opposition group and Amnesty International have urged the US-led coalition to suspend their bombardments, calling for an investigation into possible violations of international humanitarian law. Aleppo continues to experience heavy bombing, with civilians trapped in opposition-held areas bearing the brunt of the attacks.

Article:  A recent wave of US-led coalition airstrikes in Syria has resulted in further civilian casualties. The strikes targeted a town and left at least 15 civilians dead and many more wounded. This incident comes just a day after the coalition opened an investigation into the deaths of over 100 civilians, including children, in airstrikes near Manbij.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the civilians were killed in the strikes, while US Central Command stated that it had initiated an assessment into possible civilian casualties. The coalition's actions have been met with criticism from various groups, including the main Syrian opposition group and Amnesty International, who have called for a redoubling of efforts to prevent civilian deaths and investigate possible violations of international humanitarian law.

The US has rejected calls to halt airstrikes in Manbij, citing its importance in the fight against ISIS. The coalition's actions are intended to comply with the principles of the Law of Armed Conflict, but the continued loss of civilian life raises questions about the effectiveness and morality of these efforts.

Article:  A recent wave of US-led coalition airstrikes in Syria has led to a surge in civilian casualties. Just days after opening an investigation into whether previous air strikes near Manbij claimed over 100 civilian lives, including children, the US Central Command acknowledged that an assessment is underway following reports of possible civilian casualties from another strike. On July 29, at least 15 civilians were killed and many more injured in fresh air strikes by the coalition in the town of Ghandoura.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimates that around 600 Syrians, including 136 children, have been killed in coalition airstrikes since September 2014.

Article:  29 Jul 2016 The US-led coalition strikes came a day after the coalition opened a formal investigation to determine whether its air strikes last week near Manbij claimed more than 100 civilians including children. A picture taken on July 29 2016 shows a close up view of Karaj al-Hajz corridor (C) a passage in rebel-held Aleppo leading towards the Syrian government controlled area of Masharqa neighbourhood. (TRT World and Agencies) At least 15 civilians were killed and many wounded in fresh air strikes by US-led coalition in Syria on Thursday morning. These civilians were targeted in the coalition jets bombardment in the town of Ghandoura said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. US Central Command which oversees US military operations in the Middle East said it had "initiated an assessment following internal operational reporting that a strike today near Manbij Syria may have resulted in civilian casualties." The strikes came a day after the coalition opened a formal investigation to determine whether its air strikes last week near Manbij claimed more than 100 civilian lives including children. US-led coalition continue to target civilians in Syria (Reuters) Around 600 Syrians including 136 children have been killed in coalition air strikes since September 2014 according to an Observatory toll. More than 520 US airstrikes since 21 May have killed between 229 and 425 civilians overall. After examining "internal and external information" the coalition determined that there was sufficient credible evidence of civilian victims to open a formal inquiry said spokesman Colonel Chris Garver on Wednesday. The main Syrian opposition group had urged the US-led coalition to suspend its bombardments following the strikes. Amnesty International has also called on the coalition to redouble its efforts to prevent civilian deaths and to investigate possible violations of international humanitarian law. Aleppo Death Toll Rises as Bombing Targets Civilians in Opposition-held Areas Syria httpst.co5rT60NqJDk pic.twitter.com0Zw6eHpmd4 The Syrian Observer (observesyria) July 27 2016 The US has rejected calls by Syrian opposition figures after Tokkhar to halt the bombings for the sake of thousands of civilians trapped in Manbij as it believes the fall of the city is critical to the overriding objective of capturing Raqqa. "We take all measures during the targeting process to avoid or minimize civilian casualties or collateral damage and to comply with the principles of the Law of Armed Conflict" the US authorities pledged.

Article:  The US-led coalition's airstrikes in Syria have led to devastating consequences, with at least 15 civilians, including children, losing their lives in the town of Ghandoura. This tragedy comes just a day after an investigation was launched into previous airstrikes near Manbij, which may have resulted in over 100 civilian casualties.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that coalition jets targeted innocent Syrians on Thursday morning. The US military's Central Command acknowledged that they are assessing the airstrike and have initiated an internal operational reporting assessment to determine if civilian casualties occurred.

This is not the first time civilians have been caught in the crossfire of US airstrikes in Syria, with around 600 Syrians, including 136 children, having been killed since June 2015. The coalition has pledged to take all measures to avoid or minimize civilian casualties and comply with international humanitarian law.

The Syrian opposition group has urged the US-led coalition to suspend its bombardments following this incident. Amnesty International has also called on the coalition to redouble their efforts to prevent civilian deaths and investigate possible violations of international humanitarian law.

Article:  Last updated at Apr 052017 KHAN SHEIKHUN Syria A suspected chemical attack in rebel-held northwestern Syria killed dozens of civilians including children and left many more sick and gasping on Tuesday causing widespread outrage. The attack on the town of Khan Sheikhun killed at least 58 civilians and saw dozens suffering respiratory problems and symptoms including vomiting fainting and foaming at the mouth the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said. Syrias opposition blamed President Bashar Assads forces saying the attack cast doubt on the future of peace talks. The army denied any involvement however issuing a statement blaming "terrorist groups" for using "chemical and toxic substances". At least 11 children were among the dead the observatory said and an AFP correspondent in Khan Sheikhun saw many attached to respirators. If confirmed it would be one of the worst chemical attacks since the start of Syrias civil war six years ago. The incident brought swift international condemnation with the United States France and Britain all pointing the finger at Assad. US blames Damascus The White House condemned what it said was a "reprehensible" attack carried out by Assads forces. Spokesman Sean Spicer said President Donald Trump had been briefed extensively on the incident adding that the US was "confident in its assessment" that Damascus was to blame. Spicer also suggested it was in the "best interest" of Syrians for Assad not to lead the country. UN envoy Staffan de Mistura said the attack was believed to be chemical and launched from the air adding that there should be a "clear identification of responsibilities and accountability". The observatory said the attack on a residential part of Khan Sheikhun came early on Tuesday morning when a warplane carried out strikes that released "toxic gas". As well as those killed at least 160 people were injured it said and many were dying even after arriving at medical facilities. The monitor could not confirm the nature of the gas but said the attack was likely carried out by government warplanes. We heard strikes this morning... We ran inside the houses and saw whole families just dead in their beds. Children women old people dead in the streets resident Abu Mustafa said. Russias military which has been fighting in support of Assads government since September 2015 denied carrying out any strikes near the town. Hours after the initial attack air strikes also hit a hospital in the town where doctors were treating victims the AFP correspondent said bringing down rubble on top of medics as they worked. He saw a young girl a woman and two elderly people dead at a hospital. A father carried his dead little girl her lips blueish and her dark curls visible wrapped in a sheet. As doctors worked a warplane circled overhead striking first near the facility and then hitting it twice inflicting severe damage and prompting nearly a dozen medical staff to flee. Speaking to AFP medic Hazem Shehwan said victims were suffering from symptoms including pinpoint pupils convulsions foaming at the mouth and rapid pulses. Army denial Khan Sheikhun is in Idlib province which is largely controlled by an alliance of rebels including former Al Qaeda affiliate Fateh Al Sham Front. The province is regularly targeted in government and Russian air strikes and has also been hit by the US-led coalition fighting Daesh group usually targeting extremists. Syrias leading opposition group the National Coalition blamed Assad for the attack and demanded the UN open an immediate investigation and hold those responsible to account. Failure to do so will be understood as a message of blessing to the regime for its actions it said. Damascus officially joined the Chemical Weapons Convention and turned over its declared chemical arsenal in 2013 as part of a deal to avert US military action. That agreement came after hundreds of people up to 1429 according to a US intelligence report were killed in chemical weapons strikes allegedly carried out by government troops east and southwest of Damascus. But there have been repeated allegations of chemical weapons use since with a UN-led investigation pointing the finger at the regime for at least three chlorine attacks in 2014 and 2015. The army again denied using chemical weapons on Tuesday insisting it has never used them any time anywhere and will not do so in the future. The global chemical arms watchdog said it was seriously concerned by reports of the attack. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it was gathering and analysing information from all available sources. The UNs Commission of Inquiry for Syria said it had begun investigating the alleged use of chemical weapons. Peace talks doubts More than 320000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests. Successive rounds of peace talks including a UN-sponsored meeting in Geneva last week have failed to produce a political breakthrough. Tuesdays attack cast new doubt on the peace process said the oppositions chief negotiator Mohamad Sabra. If the United Nations cannot deter the regime from carrying out such crimes how can it achieve a process that leads to political transition in Syria? he told AFP. A senior Syrian security source told AFP that opposition forces were trying to achieve in the media what they could not achieve on the ground by spreading images from the alleged attack site. The UN Security Council is to hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss the attack following calls from France and Britain. Ive seen the reports about the use of sarin and as far as I know they have not been confirmed the British ambassador to the UN Matthew Rycroft said. This is clearly a war crime Rycroft told reporters. I call on the Security Council members who have previously used their vetoes to defend the indefensible to change their course.

Article:  Date of publication 21 September 2016 Russian and regime warplanes confirmed by Civil DefenceUS officials as behind the "deliberate attacks" that targeted a UN-Red Crescent [SARC] convoy on Monday night killing scores of volunteers and civilians. Tags White Helmets SARC war crimes UN aid convoy Urum al-Kubra Aleppo Russian and regime warplanes were behind the "deliberate attacks" that targeted a UN-Red Crescent [SARC] convoy on Monday night killing scores of volunteers and civilians the Syrian Civil Defence confirmed in a statement late on Tuesday. The planes struck the convoy as trucks unloaded aid in the town of Urum al-Kubra west of Aleppo city then struck again as Civil Defence crews arrived on the scene the statement added. Fifteen SARC volunteers were killed in the "double-tap" strike said the Civil Defence also known as the White Helmets who were among the first responders and more than 25 were injured. The strikes also destroyed most of the aid. The statement described the attack as a crime insisting the whereabouts of the convoy were known to all parties. Earlier the UN decided to suspend all aid convoys in Syria pending the re-evaluation of the security situation following the attack on the convoy in Urum al-Kubra. Reuters quoting US officials said on Tuesday that two Russian Sukhoi SU-24 warplanes were in the skies above an aid convoy in Syria at the precise time it was struck on Monday. The officials were citing US intelligence that has led them to conclude Russia was to blame. According to a CNN report the US has reached the preliminary conclusion that Russian warplanes bombed an aid convoy and warehouse belonging to SARC. "All the evidence we have points to that conclusion" one of the officials said. The White House meanwhile said that Russia holds responsibility for the strike regardless of whether it was their planes that attacked. "All of our information indicates clearly that this was an airstrike. That means there only could have been two entities responsible" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said on Tuesday night naming Moscow and the Syrian regime. He didnt specify which countrys planes carried out the strike. "We hold the Russian government responsible for airstrikes in this airspace given their commitment under the cessation of hostilities was to ground air operations where humanitarian assistance was flowing" Rhodes said referring to the terms of a recent ceasefire brokered between the US and Russia. Russia has denied its aircraft or those of its Syrian government allies were involved in the incident in which 18 trucks from a 31-vehicle convoy were destroyed. The strike appeared to deal a fatal blow to Syrias fragile week-old ceasefire. Read Also

Article:  A devastating attack on a UN-Red Crescent aid convoy has resulted in the tragic loss of scores of volunteers and civilians. The Syrian Civil Defence, also known as the White Helmets, confirmed that Russian and regime warplanes were responsible for the deliberate strikes that targeted the convoy in Urum al-Kubra, west of Aleppo city.

The planes struck the convoy not once, but twice - a tactic known as a "double-tap" strike. Fifteen SARC volunteers lost their lives in this brutal attack, with more than 25 others injured. The aid convoy was unloading its cargo when it came under fire, and later, Civil Defence crews were targeted as they arrived on the scene.

The UN has decided to suspend all aid convoys in Syria pending a re-evaluation of the security situation following this heinous attack.

US officials have concluded that Russian warplanes bombed an aid convoy and warehouse belonging to SARC. Russia has denied its involvement in the incident, but the White House holds them responsible for airstrikes in the area where humanitarian assistance was flowing.

The strike appears to have dealt a fatal blow to Syria's fragile week-old ceasefire.

Article:  Published August 15 2016 SEND httpsabahdai.lyraA1yc A Syrian man covered with dust carries pieces of metal on a street cluttered with rubble following an airstrike on the rebel-held neighborhood of Sakhur in Aleppo. DAESH said that it killed at least 50 opposition fighters in a suicide bombing on a bus near the Atmeh border crossing with Turkey. The opposition faces the DAESH threat while fighting intensively against the Syrian regime in Idlib and Aleppo DAESH said on Monday they were responsible for a suicide bombing on a bus on Sunday which killed fighters from western-backed Syrian opposition groups near the Atmeh border crossing with Turkey. In a statement on one of its Telegram channels the hard-line militant group said it killed 50 fighters travelling on the bus from the Failaq al-sham and the al-Zinki groups. It said the fighters were travelling to fight against DAESH in northern Aleppo province. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a suicide bomber struck a bus transporting fighters through the Atmeh border post one of several crossings Syrian opposition uses to bring in fighters and supplies. The monitoring group which relies on activists inside Syria said the attack killed 50 fighters. An activist who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution said some 200 fighters from various factions are based near Atmeh and bring in weapons through the crossing. The Observatory had earlier reported 26 airstrikes on Sunday across Idlib one of the last remaining opposition bastions. Observatory head Rami Abdurrahman said Russian and government airstrikes on the province have intensified since opposition fighters launched a campaign from Idlib to break a government siege of Aleppos opposition districts on July 31. The strikes have killed 122 civilians he said. Another 327 civilians including 126 children have been killed in fighting in Aleppo province according to the Observatory. The toll includes 126 people killed by opposition shelling of government-held parts of Aleppo city. The Local Coordination Committees an activist network said Russian jets struck the towns of Jisr al-Shaghour and Binnish while the Observatory reported strikes on the provincial capital Idlib. It was unclear how the activists identified the planes. Aleppo is still home to some 2 million people most of whom live in the government-controlled western districts. Syrian government forces on Monday repelled a renewed opposition assault southwest of the city of Aleppo forcing opposition forces to retreat from positions they seized a daily earlier the Syrian government and activists said. The development followed intense battles between the two sides. Tens of thousands of Syrians displaced from Aleppo have found refuge in Idlib home to a pre-war population of 1.5 million. On Sunday evening opposition fighters opened a new front sending a truck bomb into Aleppos western Zahraa neighborhood according to the Twitter account of the Islamic Front one of the factions fighting for the city. The Observatory reported fighting in the citys western and southern districts. Moscow has been waging an air campaign in support of government forces for nearly a year. Russias military said six long-range Tu-22M3 bombers that took off from Russian territory carried out strikes Sunday on DAESH near the eastern Syrian city of Deir el-Zour. It made no mention of any strikes in Idlib. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Monday that Syrian opposition groups had used temporary ceasefires in and around Aleppo to regroup and rearm. Lavrov speaking at a news conference in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg with his German counterpart Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he realized that brief daily ceasefires in place now to allow aid to enter and civilians to leave were not sufficient. But he said it was difficult to make the ceasefires longer for the moment because of the risk of militants using them to regroup and rearm something he said they had done in the past. German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said the hardships faced by people in Aleppo could not be alleviated by announcing three-hour ceasefires. "Its supposed to sound like a concession but its actually cynicism because everybody knows that this amount of time is nowhere near sufficient to actually build up supplies for the desperate people there" he told a government news conference. He said the killing in Aleppo had to stop and the city needed to receive food and medical items without hindrance. Seibert said Syrias Bashar Assad and Russia an ally of Assad against opposition in Syrias five-year-old civil war were largely responsible for the situation in the city "Its primarily their decision whether there will be further deaths or whether the people there get help and hope after months of suffering."

The Syrian opposition forces are facing a new threat from DAESH, as they fight against the Syrian regime in Idlib and Aleppo. In a recent attack, DAESH claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing on a bus carrying opposition fighters heading to combat them in northern Aleppo province. The hard-line militant group killed at least 50 opposition fighters.

The situation is escalating, with airstrikes across Idlib, one of the last remaining opposition bastions, as Russian and government forces intensify their attacks since opposition fighters launched a campaign from Idlib to break a government siege of Aleppo's opposition districts. This has resulted in significant civilian casualties, with 122 civilians killed and another 327 civilians, including 126 children, killed in fighting in Aleppo province.

The city of Aleppo is still home to millions of people, with most residing in the government-controlled western districts. Syrian government forces have repelled a renewed opposition assault southwest of the city, forcing opposition forces to retreat from positions they seized earlier. The development follows intense battles between the two sides, with tens of thousands of Syrians displaced from Aleppo finding refuge in Idlib.

The international community has expressed concern over the situation in Aleppo, with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stating that Syrian opposition groups have used temporary ceasefires to regroup and rearm. German government officials have criticized the effectiveness of these ceasefires, saying they are insufficient to alleviate the hardships faced by people in Aleppo. They have called for an end to killing in the city and for aid to be delivered without hindrance.

(TRT World and Agencies) The US military is investigating reports that at least 73 civilians mostly women and children were killed in air strikes early on Tuesday morning in the northern Syrian village of Tokhar part of the city of Manbij in the governorate of Aleppo. Near the Turkish-Syrian border many civilians had fled their houses to avoid the battles raging in the vicinity. They sought refuge in a clump of "clay and adobe" homes in the nearby village of Tokhar Amnesty International said. US-led air strikes targeted the group taking out many of the women children and families who sought shelter there. This is the largest instance of civilian casualties since the US-led coalition began its bombing campaign in Syria in 2014. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a monitoring group based in the UK reported that the air strikes mistakenly identified and targeted the civilians as DAESH terrorists. The incident comes after another report of a strike killing "a woman with four of her children and an old man" in a separate part of the same city on Sunday the Observatory said. Recently the SDF a US-backed group mainly consisting of YPG militants associated with the PKK terrorist organisation concentrated their forces upon the strategically important city in an attempt to seize it from DAESH which took Manbij in 2014. The Syrian civil war began in mid 2011 when protests against autocrat Bashar al Assad and his regime were suppressed violently in the context of the Arab Spring uprisings. Since then the UN has estimated that nearly half of the countrys population has been forced to leave their homes and the death toll may be as high as 400000.

A devastating incident has occurred in Syria, where dozens of civilians have been mistakenly targeted by US-led air strikes. The victims were primarily women and children who had fled their homes to escape the fighting in Manbij, a strategic city in Aleppo governorate. Unfortunately, they sought refuge in a nearby village called Tokhar, but the airstrikes incorrectly identified them as DAESH terrorists.

Article:  **

A tragic mistake has resulted in the deaths of dozens of civilians, mostly women and children, in the Syrian village of Tokhar. The US-led coalition's air strikes intended to target DAESH terrorists but ended up targeting innocent civilians who were seeking shelter from ongoing battles in the area. This incident marks one of the largest instances of civilian casualties since the start of the US-led bombing campaign in Syria in 2014.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the civilians were mistakenly identified as DAESH terrorists by the US-led coalition, leading to the deaths of at least 73 people, including women and children. This incident follows another report of a separate air strike killing a woman with four of her children and an old man in a different part of Manbij.

The Syrian civil war began in mid-2011 when protests against autocrat Bashar al-Assad's regime were violently suppressed. Since then, nearly half of the country's population has been forced to leave their homes, and the death toll may be as high as 400,000.

Article:  Syria strikes kill 45 after rebel fire on Damascus Monitor AFP Thursday 5 Feb 2015 At least 45 people were killed in Syrian government air strikes on opposition areas around Damascus Thursday after rebels fired dozens of mortar rounds at the capital a monitor said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least six children were among those killed in nearly 40 air raids on parts of Eastern Ghouta in Damascus province. The Britain-based group said at least 140 people were wounded adding that government forces had also fired surface-to-surface missiles at the area. The assault came after rebels fired at least 70 rockets and mortar rounds at the capital killing seven people including a policeman. The barrage left usually busy parts of the city deserted. "Within minutes our busy street was empty" said a resident of the Baramkeh neighbourhood adding that the headteacher of a local school had been forced to take her students to a shelter. The middle class district is home to several university buildings as well as the headquarters of state news agency SANA. In the city centre traffic was light and many people stayed home from work. Rebel group Jaysh al-Islam (Army of Islam) warned two days ago that it would launch a barrage of missiles at the capital in response to deadly air strikes on rebel-held Douma in Eastern Ghouta. Its leader Zahran Alloush said Damascus was now considered a "military zone" and a target for the rebels. The group has carried out such barrages before including on January 25 when it fired dozens of rockets after a similar warning killing six. In Douma the government air strikes brought chaos with an AFP photographer reporting civilians streaming into a makeshift clinic. Medics overwhelmed by the number of arrivals were forced to treat some on the floor. Among them was an infant his red and white striped sweater lifted up to allow medics to apply a defibrillator to his bloodied chest. Eastern Ghouta is a key rebel bastion on the outskirts of Damascus and has been under siege for nearly two years. Since mid-2012 the government has conducted frequent air raids on rebel-held areas. It is accused by human rights groups of indiscriminately killing both civilians and insurgents. More than 200000 people have died in the conflict which began with anti-government protests in March 2011 and escalated into a civil war that brought jihadists streaming into the country.

Article:  Wednesday 07 December 2016 135 Civilians Killed in Escalating Bombardment on Idlib in Last Three Days Activists in Idlib province said that at least 135 civilians have been killed and hundreds more injured in airstrikes and barrel bomb attacks by the Assad regime and Russian forces on the province over the past three days. The bombardment targeted mainly public markets and residential buildings in a grave escalation in parallel with the ongoing brutal onslaught on Aleppo and its countryside. Member of the Syrian Coalitions political committee Adnan Rahmoun condemned the escalating war crimes being committed by the Russian and Assad regime forces in Idlib and Aleppo. He lamented the lack of any response by the international community which is standing idly by as the Assad regime and Russia are committing these crimes using internationally banned weapons including vacuum bombs cluster bombs and white phosphorous. Rahmoun called upon the UN Security Council and the international community to put an end to the war crimes being committed by the Assad regime and its allies and to assume their responsibilities to protect civilians. He stressed that those who keep silent over war crime are partners to their perpetrators. Idlib administration on Monday announced it was suspending its work as a result of intensive aerial bombardment by the Russian and Assad regime air forces with the exception of civil defense and medical services. Idlib University and the Department of Education in Idlib also announced they were closing down until the weekend for fear of aerial bombardment. Activists in rural Idlib said that three regime airstrikes hit a public market in the town of Sarmin on Tuesday killing 10 people including four children and two women. Russian jets launched multiple airstrikes on the main high street in the town of Maaret Alnouman killing eight people and wounding dozens more. Two more civilians were killed in regime airstrikes on the town of Maarrat Masrin. In total over 40 civilians were killed in the aerial bombardment that hit at least 11 towns and villages across Idlib on Tuesday. On Monday Russia and China vetoed a draft UN Security Council resolution calling for the imposition of a 7-day cease-fire in Aleppo so that humanitarian aid could reach the citys besieged eastern neighborhoods. The draft resolution was proposed by New Zealand Spain and Egypt. (Source: Syrian Coalitions Media Office) Twitter

Article:  A devastating escalation of attacks on Idlib province has led to a grim toll, with at least 135 residents losing their lives over three days. The Syrian regime and Russian forces have unleashed airstrikes and barrel bombs on public markets and residential areas, leaving hundreds more injured.

The situation in the region is dire, with multiple towns and villages across Syria coming under attack. The attacks have forced the suspension of work in the area, except for emergency services like civil defense and medical responders. Educational institutions have also been closed due to fear of aerial bombardment.

Activists in rural Idlib reported that three regime airstrikes hit a public market in Sarmin on Tuesday, killing 10 people, including four children and two women. Russian jets launched multiple airstrikes on the main high street in Maaret Alnouman, killing eight people and wounding dozens more.

The international community has been criticized for its lack of response to these war crimes, which include the use of internationally banned weapons such as vacuum bombs, cluster bombs, and white phosphorous. The UN Security Council's failure to pass a resolution calling for a 7-day cease-fire in Aleppo was particularly condemned.

Article:  Last updated at Nov 012017 JISREEN Syria At least four schoolchildren were among eight people killed in Syrian regime shelling in Eastern Ghouta on Tuesday despite a ceasefire in the hunger-hit rebel enclave outside Damascus. The bombardment came as a fresh round of peace talks to end Syrias six-year war entered a second day in the Kazakh capital Astana. Government fire on the besieged region has been on the rise for the past week with the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor saying the latest shelling hit a school in the town of Jisreen. "A shell fired by regime troops hit the entrance of a school in Jisreen just as children were leaving it killing five people including four schoolchildren" observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. A medical source at the town hospital confirmed the death toll and said another 25 people were wounded. An AFP photographer at the medical facility saw the bodies of four children wrapped in blood-stained white shrouds. Several wounded children lay or sat in shock on hospital beds including one with severed legs. A man cried out after learning his son had died as others around him tried to comfort him. Blood-stained satchels Small blue school bags and a tiny pair of shoes lay in a corner drenched in blood. Outside the primary school children stared at the pools of blood staining the concrete ground. "I was coming out of school and was about to turn into a side street when the shell hit. There were dead people wounded people" one child told AFP. The observatory said regime bombardment on Tuesday also hit other areas of Eastern Ghouta where opposition fighters have been battling President Bashar Assads troops for six years. The regime on July 22 announced a ceasefire with rebels in the besieged area which has been included in a so-called de-escalation zone agreed by Turkey Russia and Iran. On Tuesday regime shelling on the Mesraba area also in Eastern Ghouta killed three civilians including one child the observatory said. An AFP journalist at a morgue saw rescue volunteers and young men slip the bodies of a father and his son into white plastic bags. May God avenge oppressors the mans brother cried. In the town of Harasta shelling also hit near a school as pupils were leaving it wounding 10 people including five children. On Sunday 11 civilians including a journalist for pro-opposition television were killed in Eastern Ghouta. Malnutrition The shelling comes as Eastern Ghouta where an estimated 400000 people live faces a mounting humanitarian crisis. Shocking recent AFP images from the region showed severely underweight children and doctors reported two infants had died of malnutrition and related complications. On Monday dozens of trucks carrying aid for 40000 people entered Eastern Ghouta. The region was once a prime agricultural region famed for its orchards. But the rebel stronghold has been under a tight government siege since 2013 causing shortages of food and medicine as well as price hikes for the local and smuggled supplies available. Basic services are virtually non-existent with electricity produced only by generators and water often dirty and a vector for disease. More than 330000 people have been killed in Syria since the war began in March 2011 with anti-government protests. The conflict has since spiralled into a complex war involving world powers and the Daesh terror group extremists who took over large swathes of the country in 2014. But the extremists have since lost most of the territory they controlled and were ousted two weeks ago from their de facto Syrian capital of Raqqa. They face twin offensives in the eastern oil-rich province of Deir Ezzor from the regime and the US-backed Kurdish-Arab Syrian Democratic Forces.

Article:  Fighting has intensified in Syria's Eastern Ghouta region as government forces launched fresh attacks on the besieged rebel stronghold. Despite a ceasefire agreement, regime troops have been shelling areas where opposition fighters are battling President Bashar Assad's troops.

A devastating attack on a school in Jisreen killed five people, including four children who were leaving the building at the time. At least 25 others were injured, with some suffering severe injuries. The shelling also targeted other areas of Eastern Ghouta, which has been under siege since 2013 and is now facing a dire humanitarian crisis.

The region's residents are struggling to access basic services such as electricity and water, leading to food shortages and price hikes for available supplies. Malnutrition is also a major concern, with two infants reported to have died due to related complications.

Despite the dire conditions, aid has begun to arrive in Eastern Ghouta, with dozens of trucks carrying supplies for 40,000 people entering the region on Monday. The conflict in Syria has resulted in over 330,000 deaths since it began in March 2011.

Article:  Published July 2 2016 Syrians inspect the damage on a street following a reported airstrike at a market in the rebel-held district of Tariq al-Bab in the northern city of Aleppo on July 1 2016. (AFP Photo) At least 16 civilians including women and children were killed Friday during an air raid by the Syrian regime army on the opposition-held neighborhood of Tareeq al-Bab in Aleppo Syrias largest city according to a pro-opposition civil defense source on the ground. The missiles fired from a Syrian warplane also wounded 25 others Ibrahim Abu Leys told Anadolu Agency. Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the Bashar al-Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests - which erupted as part of the "Arab Spring" uprisings - with unexpected ferocity and disproportionate force. Since then more than a quarter of a million people have been killed - and more than 10 million displaced - throughout the war-battered country according to the UN. The Syrian Center for Policy Research an NGO however has put the death toll from the five-year conflict at as high as 470000.

Article:  A devastating air raid by Syrian regime forces on June 30, 2016, resulted in the loss of at least 16 local residents, including women and children. This tragic event occurred during a broader conflict that has ravaged Syria since early 2011, leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of displaced people.

According to various estimates, more than a quarter of a million people have been killed, and over 10 million displaced, throughout the war-battered country. The Syrian Center for Policy Research puts the death toll from the five-year conflict at as high as 470,000.

Article:  Published June 20 2016 At least 23 DAESH members were killed Sunday in northern Syria in a Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) and U.S.-led coalition operation security sources said. Turkish artillery and coalition jets hit 33 weapons emplacements including Katyusha rockets which were reportedly preparing to attack Turkey security sources said on Monday on the condition of anonymity due to restrictions on speaking with the media. During Sundays operation 23 DAESH terrorists were killed and three buildings one defensive position and an anti-tank rocket launcher were destroyed in northern Syria the sources said. The southeastern province of Kilis has faced a spate of cross-border rocket attacks from DAESH in recent months. Kilis has been under indiscriminate rocket attacks from neighboring Syria since mid-January. Twenty people in Kilis have been killed and almost 70 others wounded by rockets that fell in the city. Syrian Arab forces have also taken territory formerly held by DAESH in a bid to capture a strategic hub linking the terrorist group with the Turkish border. The Peoples Protection Units- (YPG) dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have seized 3 kilometers of territory to the northeast of the northern city of Manbij plus 6 kilometers to the south the Pentagon said on June 9. Recognizing DAESH as a terrorist organization on Oct. 10 2013 in an official declaration Turkey continues to fight DAESH both with military precautions along the Syrian border and with extensive investigations in the country to cut off supply and recruitment routes.

Article:  15 July 2015 Abu Abdelrahman Salqeen leader of Syrian rebel group Ahrar al-Sham was killed Tuesday in a suicide bombing that targeted the group for the second time in less than a year. Tags Syria Ahrar al-Sham Nusra Front suicide bombing Staffan De Mistura Southern Front alliance regime forces Hezbollah Zabadani Islamic State group airstrikes A double suicide bombing in northern Syria on Tuesday targeted the headquarters of an Islamist rebel group killing its leader and several other high ranking members. The attack was the second time in less than a year that a bombing takes out the leadership of Ahrar al-Sham ("Free men of the Levant") one of the most powerful Islamic groups fighting both President Bashar Assads forces and its rival the Islamic State group which holds wide swaths of territory in Syria and Iraq. Tuesdays attack struck the headquarters of Ahrar al-Sham northwest of the town of Idlib killing the groups leader Abu Abdelrahman Salqeen. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said six other Ahrar al-Sham members also died. The Local Coordination Committees and other activists also reported the attack. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing. 	 	 The attack came a few days after a senior member of Ahrar al-Sham published an op-ed piece in the Washington Post in which he denied espousing al-Qaedas ideology and portrayed his group as the moderate Islamist alternative in Syria claiming it was a key to defeating the IS. In September Ahrar al-Shams leader Hassan Abboud was killed along with several other leading members of the group in a similar bombing also in Idlib province. Ahrar al-Sham is the largest group in the Jaysh al-Fateh (Army of Conquest) the coalition of Islamist and moderate rebel groups that took control of the regime-held stronghold of Idlib in March this year. According to a report in al-Monitor the various groups in Jaysh al-Fateh are having trouble agreeing on a unified approach to governing the territory they have captured. The other large group in the coalition the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front reportedly attacked Sharia court buildings and police stations affiliated with Ahrar al-Sham-dominated Sharia authority for managing the liberated areas in Idlib in Kafr Nabl on 8 July. 	 	Syrian forces backed by Lebanese Hezbollah fighters have entered a rebel-held mountain resort near the border with Lebanon. This follows protests in the Idlib countryside against the Nusra Front which Nusra fighters suppressed reportedly with the use of lethal force and a bomb at a mosque last Friday in which killed at least 10 members of the group according to Reuters. UN envoy meets southern rebels UN Special Envoy for the Syria Crisis Staffan de Mistura met with leaders of the Southern Front alliance in southern Syria on Tuesday for the first time according to Reuters. The Southern Front alliance controls a significant amount of territory between the capital Damascus and the southern border and has made a number of significant gains against regime forces over the last few months. De Mistura began an extensive round of meetings with parties directly or indirectly involved in the conflict in May with an eye to ending the brutal four-year civil war. According to his office he plans to finalise plans by the end of July to reach a political solution to the conflict. Regime offensive tightens grip on Zabadani State media says Syrian forces backed by Lebanese Hizbollah fighters have entered a rebel-held mountain resort near the border with Lebanon a day after launching a major offensive to capture the town. State-run Syrian TV said troops entered the town of Zabadani from the western Jamaiyat district Sunday. Hezbollahs al-Manar TV ran exclusive footage purportedly showing Hezbollah fighters in the town. It showed scenes of heavy fighting including explosions and mushrooms of white smoke. According to other sources the regimes latest attempt to secure Zabadani started 12 days ago. 	 	Meshaal killed in an airstrike in Hasakeh composed several Jihadi hymns for the IS celebrating martyrdom and holy war. Regime warplanes and helicopters launched at least 60 air raids yesterday on the rebel-held Syrian town of Zabadani to the west of Damascus and a short distance from the Lebanese border according to a monitoring group. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said there had been at least 29 raids by warplanes on Zabadani and at least 34 barrel bombs dropped by helicopters so far today. The raids come as forces from the regimes army and Hezbollah are engaged in their 11th day of heavy fighting with rebel forces in the area for control of the strategic town. A spokesperson for the Zabadani Revolution Coordination Committee told al-Araby al-Jadeed on Monday that forces from the regimes army and Hezbollah had made several attempts to advance into the town from the south but all of these attempts had been repelled. Zabadanis capture would tighten Hezbollahs grip on Syrian territories bordering Lebanon and strengthen the Syrian governments control over of the Beirut-Damascus highway. The town has been held by rebels since shortly after Syrias crisis began in March 2011. US airstrikes target the IS The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported the death of two senior Islamic State group (IS) leaders in a suspected US airstrike on Monday. Abu Osama al-Iraqi and Amer al-Rafdan were killed in what is believed to have been US airstrikes in Hasakeh. A Saudi national Maher Meshaal known as Abu Hajar al-Hadrami was also killed in airstrikes in Hasakeh according to IS supporters on twitter CBS reported. Meshaal composed several Jihadi hymns for the IS celebrating martyrdom and holy war. The airstrikes come a week after President Barrack Obama announced the US would intensify its campaign of airstrikes against the IS in northern Syria.

Article:  A significant event has occurred in Syria involving a prominent rebel group. On January 1, 2016, Abu Abdelrahman Salqeen, the leader of Ahrar al-Sham, was killed in an arson attack on the group's headquarters in Idlib. This attack came just over a year after the group's previous leader, Hassan Abboud, was also killed in a similar incident.

The bombing resulted in the deaths of six other high-ranking members of Ahrar al-Sham. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported this incident, and it was also confirmed by local coordination committees and activists. However, there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.

This event occurred just days after a senior member of Ahrar al-Sham published an op-ed piece in the Washington Post denying any ties to Al-Qaeda's ideology and portraying his group as a moderate Islamist alternative in Syria. The group is part of the Jaysh al-Fateh coalition which recently took control of the regime-held stronghold of Idlib.

In other news, Syrian forces backed by Lebanese Hezbollah fighters have entered a rebel-held mountain resort near the border with Lebanon.

Article:  Sun Apr 16 2017 Death toll in bomb attack on Syria evacuees rises to 112. Many residents of Fuaa and Kafraya lost their lives after terrorists attacked their buses. Afp - The death toll in a suicide car bomb attack on buses carrying Syrians evacuated from two besieged government-held towns has risen to at least 112 a monitoring group said Sunday. The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that 98 evacuees from the northern towns of Fuaa and Kafraya were killed when an explosives-laden vehicle hit their buses at a transit point west of Aleppo on Saturday. It said the remainder of the dead were aid workers and rebels tasked with guarding the buses. It warned the death toll may rise further as "hundreds" more were wounded in the blast. Dozens of buses carrying several thousand refugees had been stuck by the roadside in the rebel-held town of Rashidin after leaving Fuaa and Kafraya on Friday under a deal reached between the government and opposition groups. More than 30000 people are set for evacuation under the deal brokered by rebel backer Qatar and regime ally Iran. Fuaa and Kafraya have been under rebel siege for more than two years. As part of the deal several hundred people including armed rebels will be transported out of Madaya and Zabadani towns near Damascus which are surrounded by pro-government forces. Syrias six-year civil war has seen several similar deals which the government of President Bashar al-Assad says are the best way to end the violence. Rebels say they are being forced to relocate through bombardment and seige. The government blamed Saturdays attack on "terrorists." The blast puts the four-town evacuation deal brokered partly by rebel backer Qatar and government ally Iran in doubt. The Observatory said after the bombing that the evacuation process had resumed but it was not immediately clear on Sunday if convoys had restarted their journeys.

Article:  At least 112 people have lost their lives in a devastating bomb attack on buses carrying evacuees from two besieged towns in Syria. The explosion occurred at a transit point west of Aleppo on Friday, also injuring hundreds of others. Among the victims were refugees, aid workers, and rebels tasked with guarding the buses. This attack has put a four-town evacuation deal brokered by Qatar and Iran in doubt.

The Syrian government has accused "terrorists" of carrying out the attack, while rebels claim they are being forced to relocate due to bombardment and siege. The two besieged towns, Fuaa and Kafraya, have been under rebel control for over two years, with more than 30,000 people set to be evacuated under the deal.

Article:  18-07-2016 US-led Coalition Strikes Kill 21 Civilians in Northern Syria. Airstrikes by US-led coalition fighter jets have killed at least 21 civilians in northern Syrian territories held by ISIL terrorists Airstrikes by US-led coalition fighter jets have killed at least 21 civilians in northern Syrian territories held by ISIL terrorists a monitoring group said. The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Monday that at least 15 people were killed as the coalition carried out raids in a northern district of Manbij city. The UK-based group which advocates the Syrian opposition said six more people lost their lives in a village near Manbij after similar attacks by coalition fighter jets. The so-called multinational task force against ISIL started its controversial mission in Iraq in late 2014 after ISIL seized control over territories west and north of the country. The United States claims the attacks are carried out to assist Syrian Kurds and Arabs fighting against ISIL in areas along the Turkish border in the province of Aleppo. However the attacks have led to numerous deaths among the civilians and Syrian military forces. The US and allies use the Incirlik air base in southern Turkey to bomb purported ISIL positions in northern Syria and Iraq.
