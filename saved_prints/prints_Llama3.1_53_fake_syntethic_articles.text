23-09-2013 ISIL Armed Groups Battle in Rural Idlib 13 Killed. Thirteen militants of the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Levant organization were killed Monday during battles with other opposition armed groups in Idlib countryside. Thirteen militants of the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Levant organization were killed Monday during battles with other opposition armed groups in Idlib countryside. The opposition UK-based Syrian observatory indicated that among the killed was a local Libyan emir who was killed during violent clashes with gunmen in the vicinity of Hazano town several kilometers away from the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey. Another seven people of a local armed group were also killed in the clash which took place after al-Qaeda terrorist organization members tried to arrest two persons of the town residents. Earlier ISIL gunmen seized the headquarters of al-Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra terrorist group in the Shaddadi area in Hasakah countryside north-east of the country. Moreover in Azaz situation is still unstable after recent clashes between the ISIL militiamen and Storm of North Brigade of the so-called free Syrian army. The free army accused the ISIL of violating the cease-fire agreement by abstaining from releasing many of the detainees. Recently fierce clashes erupted between the ISIL Al-Nusra Front and the free army in the wake of disputes on power and control sharing over areas not reclaimed so far by the Syrian army. The Syrian national military launched a wide-scale military operation in May 2013 in the countrys main provinces to restore security and release citizens from terrorist threats. Syria was hit by a violent unrest since mid-March 2011 where the Syrian government accuses foreign actors of orchestrating the conflict by supporting the militant opposition groups with arms and money.

Wednesday 30 November 2016 Coalition Letter to UN & UNSC Presses for Stopping Assads & Russias Onslaught on Aleppo. The Syrian Coalition called upon the United Nations as the main international sponsor of the political process in Syria to take immediate and decisive action to ensure the protection of the civilians in Aleppo. Action must be taken to stop the barbaric attack on the civilians in Aleppo by compelling the Assad regime to abide by the terms of a cessation of hostilities; allowing unfettered and immediate humanitarian access and medical aid to the city; holding into account those responsible for these crimes; and preventing the repetition of such gross violations.In a letter sent by President of the Syrian Coalition Anas Abdah to the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and President of the UN Security Council Fode Seck the Coalition underscored the desperate humanitarian situation in Aleppo as the regime and its allies continue their relentless indiscriminate bombardment of Aleppo and its countryside.Every hospital in Aleppo has gone out of service leaving hundreds of people injured by the indiscriminate bombardment at the risk of losing their lives for complete lack of medical care the letter said.Abdah noted that the Assad regime and his allies are turning the liberated areas of the city of Aleppo into a real coffin given that official food stocks run out and civilians are under siege.This outrageous escalation in Aleppo has killed more than 670 40% of them are children caused the displacement of more than 3000 families destroyed 11 hospitals and medical centers and known the use of the chlorine gas four times which constitutes a further crime against humanity and a war crime in the regimes long bloody record of barbarity.The letter added: On the other hand it runs in the face of all the international relations including UNSCR 2118 (2013) and 2235 (2015) concerned with the use of indiscriminate weapons in Syria and UNSCR 2254 (2015) and 2268 (2016) endorsing the cessation of hostilities and humanitarian access agreement.The letter also stressed that the Assad regime can only persist in this criminality as long as it enjoys the impunity it has enjoyed so far by the international inaction let alone the active support of its allies particularly Russia.As a pioneer of the human rights and the international peace and security in the world the United Nations has the responsibility to translate words into action to protect the civilians in Aleppo and to make sure that the regimes criminality against its own people no longer goes without consequences.

July 30 2014 Bombs in Syrias Aleppo kill 13 pro-Assad fighters: monitor. Opposition forces in Syria exploded bombs in tunnels under Aleppo late on Tuesday and killed at least 13 fighters loyal to President Bashar al-Assad in the northern city a group tracking the violence said. The bombs were placed in two tunnels running under historic parts of the city close to an old police station said the Observatory a Britain-based group which reports on Syria using a network of sources on the ground. The attack appeared to have been carried out by Islamic brigades fighting Assad it said. The blast killed government soldiers and other forces fighting alongside them the Observatory added without giving details. Syrias state news agency made no mention of the attack. Aleppo is one of Syrias main contested cities and government forces took strategic ground around it in June squeezing the main rebel supply line into the city after months of battlefield gains by Damascus. The government advance was backed by fighters from the Lebanese Shiite Muslim group Hezbollah an ally of President Bashar al-Assad sources close to the group told Reuters earlier this month. Rebels advanced into Aleppo once Syrias commercial hub in 2012 from the north and took districts in the center of the city. The army has since mainly held the west and south of Aleppo but has been unable to push out opposition fighters. Forces loyal to Assad now control most of Damascus along with the main highway from the capital through to Homs and the western Mediterranean coast. Opposition fighters including a powerful al Qaeda offshoot Islamic State control much of the desert in the north and east.

Posted on August 3 2013 by Nazeer Rida At least 12 Islamist fighters were killed in clashes with Kurdish militants in the Syrian city of Hasaka early Friday the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said. Clashes erupted on Friday at midnight between fighters from the Peoples Protection Units (YPG) on the one hand and fighters from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and the Al-Nusra Front on the other hand the SOHR announced. Fridas fighting came after renewed tensions between the two sides in Kurdish-dominated areas to the north and east of Syria. This is not the first time that Islamists linked to Al-Qaeda and Kurdish militants have fought since the Syrian crisis erupted in 2011. Rebel-on-rebel violence has been frequent in areas along the Turkish border and last month witnessed heavy clashes in the oil-rich city of Ras Al-Ayn in northeastern Syria. The ArabKurdish crisis appears to include the Free Syrian Army (FSA). A video posted on the internet showed Col. Abdul Jabbar Akidi a member of the FSA military council announcing that the FSA has sent reinforcement to Islamists. This cannot be tolerated. If it is necessary we will wipe out the PKK he said referring to the Kurdistan Workers Party. Viewed as the largest Kurdish political and military formation in Syria the Democratic Union Party (PYD) dismissed Akidis statement as unjustified. Speaking exclusively to Asharq Al-Awsat PYD spokesman Nawaf Khalil said that reasons for Akidis calls to fight Kurds are unknown and that the PKK has clearly announced that the Syrian regime and its supporters have lost legitimacy. This attack is meant to be against the entire Kurdish region on the pretext of fighting the PKK Khalil said stressing that Kurds will fight those who attack them. The PYD the Syrian franchise of the Turkish PKK is believed to stand as the largest political and military formation in Syria and has assumed control over the Kurdish-dominated areas to the east and north of Syria since July 2012 setting up checkpoints and running public affairs. Khalil reaffirmed to Asharq Al-Awsat the PYDs despire to topple the regime as well as its opposition to the Al-Qaeda-linked rebel groups such as the Al-Nusra Front. We did not want to go into battles with the Islamists particularly after the agreement we signed with them but today they are laying siege to us in addition to the siege laid by the Syrian regime on the one hand and Turkey along the borders on the other the PYD spokesman said. He added The stances of the opposition and the FSA serve the interests of the dictatorial regime. They should have looked for a formula to deal cooperate and even coordinate on the ground with the Kurdish side in the face of the regimes aggression. We work to topple the regime and coordinate with all sides but we will not accept the Islamists the regime army or the FSA entering our area. In other news the UN said it would probe reports opposition fighters committed a massacre against troops loyal to Assad in Khan Al-Assal after seizing the strategic town from the regime last week UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said in a statement. After examining videos documenting the atrocities committed by rebels Pillay said These images if verified suggest that executions were committed in Khan Al-Assal calling for a thorough independent investigation to establish whether war crimes have been committed. She also warned that all sides in Syria should not think they are immune from prosecution. Nazeer Rida

11 Oct 2016 Russian jets pounded several opposition-held parts of eastern Aleppo killing 26 people and reducing the areas to rubble. Fifteen others were killed in two more incidents of violence. The bombing by Russian jets mostly targeted several neighbourhoods in the opposition-held parts of Aleppo Syria reducing the areas to rubble. (File photo) After a lull of several days Russian jets resumed heavy bombing of eastern Aleppo on Tuesday killing 26 people. The bombing by Russian jets mostly targeted several neighbourhoods in the opposition-held parts of Aleppo reducing the areas to rubble. Up to 300000 people are still believed to be in the besieged parts of the countrys largest city. "There is renewed bombardment and it is heavy" Zakaria Malhifji of the Aleppo based Fastaqim opposition group told Reuters. Russia and the Syrian regime had reduced air raids in the northern city over the last week. Regime forces said it was partly to allow civilians to leave opposition-held eastern neighbourhoods. The regime previously said that opposition holed up in Aleppo can leave with their families if they lay down their arms but the opposition has denounced that offer as a deception. Regime leader Bashar al Assad vowed to completely recapture Aleppo which has been divided between the regime and opposition control since the war began in 2011. The War In Syria At least 26 people killed in eastern Aleppo following bombings by Russian jets - YouTube A brief a brief ceasefire between the Russian-backed regime and US-backed opposition groups that was mediated by Washington and Moscow collapsed last month.

Wed Feb 17 2016 More than 100 Terrorists Killed in Syrian Army Operations across Country. More than 100 Takfiri terrorists have been killed in two days of air and ground operations by the Syrian military across the Arab country. Syrias official news agency SANA reported on Wednesday that Syrian fighter jets targeted hideouts of the Takfiri Daesh terrorists in the town of al-Bab and several other villages in the northeastern countryside of Aleppo Province. The report said at least 70 terrorists were slain. The Syrian aircraft also dealt a heavy blow to the Takfiri militants in airstrikes on their command posts in Eastern Ghouta on the outskirts of the capital Damascus. The Syrian forces recently regained control of several areas in the same region. Also on Wednesday airstrikes by the Syrian air force targeted gathering centers of militants of the Jaish al-Fatah in Kafr Zita Jub al-Rayan and Kafr Nabudah in the northern countryside of Hama. Jaish al-Fateh terrorists suffered another blow in similar strikes on their hideouts in the province of Idlib. On Tuesday at least six Takfiri militants were killed in attacks by the Syrian ground forces in the provinces of Hama and Idlib. Separately the Syrian army released footage showing the operation of liberating two strategic villages in Aleppo. The villages of Masqan and Ehras in the northern countryside of Aleppo were liberated from the control of the Takfiri militants on Monday. The army backed by popular forces also won back the village of al-Tiba in the eastern countryside of Aleppo as well as Kafar Naya 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of Aleppo City. The Syrian army and its allies backed by Russian warplanes have recently made major advances against Takfiri militants north of Aleppo. Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi said on February 10 that the government forces will soon take full control of the militant-held areas of Aleppo but predicted a tough battle for the largest city in the Arab country. "These battles are not easy but the day will come God willing when all Aleppo - its rural areas and the occupied part of the city - will return to state authority" Zoubi said. Syria has been gripped by foreign-backed militancy since March 2011. According to a new report by the Syrian Center for Policy Research the conflict has claimed the lives of over 470000 people injured 1.9 million others and displaced nearly half of the countrys pre-war population of about 23 million within or beyond its borders Press TV reported.

Last updated at Apr 052017 KHAN SHEIKHUN Syria A suspected chemical attack in rebel-held northwestern Syria killed dozens of civilians including children and left many more sick and gasping on Tuesday causing widespread outrage. The attack on the town of Khan Sheikhun killed at least 58 civilians and saw dozens suffering respiratory problems and symptoms including vomiting fainting and foaming at the mouth the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said. Syrias opposition blamed President Bashar Assads forces saying the attack cast doubt on the future of peace talks. The army denied any involvement however issuing a statement blaming "terrorist groups" for using "chemical and toxic substances". At least 11 children were among the dead the observatory said and an AFP correspondent in Khan Sheikhun saw many attached to respirators. If confirmed it would be one of the worst chemical attacks since the start of Syrias civil war six years ago. The incident brought swift international condemnation with the United States France and Britain all pointing the finger at Assad. US blames Damascus The White House condemned what it said was a "reprehensible" attack carried out by Assads forces. Spokesman Sean Spicer said President Donald Trump had been briefed extensively on the incident adding that the US was "confident in its assessment" that Damascus was to blame. Spicer also suggested it was in the "best interest" of Syrians for Assad not to lead the country. UN envoy Staffan de Mistura said the attack was believed to be chemical and launched from the air adding that there should be a "clear identification of responsibilities and accountability". The observatory said the attack on a residential part of Khan Sheikhun came early on Tuesday morning when a warplane carried out strikes that released "toxic gas". As well as those killed at least 160 people were injured it said and many were dying even after arriving at medical facilities. The monitor could not confirm the nature of the gas but said the attack was likely carried out by government warplanes. We heard strikes this morning... We ran inside the houses and saw whole families just dead in their beds. Children women old people dead in the streets resident Abu Mustafa said. Russias military which has been fighting in support of Assads government since September 2015 denied carrying out any strikes near the town. Hours after the initial attack air strikes also hit a hospital in the town where doctors were treating victims the AFP correspondent said bringing down rubble on top of medics as they worked. He saw a young girl a woman and two elderly people dead at a hospital. A father carried his dead little girl her lips blueish and her dark curls visible wrapped in a sheet. As doctors worked a warplane circled overhead striking first near the facility and then hitting it twice inflicting severe damage and prompting nearly a dozen medical staff to flee. Speaking to AFP medic Hazem Shehwan said victims were suffering from symptoms including pinpoint pupils convulsions foaming at the mouth and rapid pulses. Army denial Khan Sheikhun is in Idlib province which is largely controlled by an alliance of rebels including former Al Qaeda affiliate Fateh Al Sham Front. The province is regularly targeted in government and Russian air strikes and has also been hit by the US-led coalition fighting Daesh group usually targeting extremists. Syrias leading opposition group the National Coalition blamed Assad for the attack and demanded the UN open an immediate investigation and hold those responsible to account. Failure to do so will be understood as a message of blessing to the regime for its actions it said. Damascus officially joined the Chemical Weapons Convention and turned over its declared chemical arsenal in 2013 as part of a deal to avert US military action. That agreement came after hundreds of people up to 1429 according to a US intelligence report were killed in chemical weapons strikes allegedly carried out by government troops east and southwest of Damascus. But there have been repeated allegations of chemical weapons use since with a UN-led investigation pointing the finger at the regime for at least three chlorine attacks in 2014 and 2015. The army again denied using chemical weapons on Tuesday insisting it has never used them any time anywhere and will not do so in the future. The global chemical arms watchdog said it was seriously concerned by reports of the attack. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it was gathering and analysing information from all available sources. The UNs Commission of Inquiry for Syria said it had begun investigating the alleged use of chemical weapons. Peace talks doubts More than 320000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests. Successive rounds of peace talks including a UN-sponsored meeting in Geneva last week have failed to produce a political breakthrough. Tuesdays attack cast new doubt on the peace process said the oppositions chief negotiator Mohamad Sabra. If the United Nations cannot deter the regime from carrying out such crimes how can it achieve a process that leads to political transition in Syria? he told AFP. A senior Syrian security source told AFP that opposition forces were trying to achieve in the media what they could not achieve on the ground by spreading images from the alleged attack site. The UN Security Council is to hold an emergency meeting on Wednesday to discuss the attack following calls from France and Britain. Ive seen the reports about the use of sarin and as far as I know they have not been confirmed the British ambassador to the UN Matthew Rycroft said. This is clearly a war crime Rycroft told reporters. I call on the Security Council members who have previously used their vetoes to defend the indefensible to change their course.

Death toll from Aleppo bus convoy bomb attack at least 126 Observatory The death toll from a bomb attack on a crowded bus convoy outside Aleppo has reached at least 126 in the deadliest such incident in Syria in almost a year the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said on Sunday. Syrian rescue workers of the Civil Defence said that they had taken away at least 100 bodies from the site of Saturdays blast which hit buses carrying Shiite residents as they waited to cross from rebel into government territory in an evacuation deal between the warring sides. The British-based Observatory said the number was expected to rise. Those killed were mostly residents of the villages of al-Foua and Kefraya in Idlib province but included rebel fighters guarding the convoy the Observatory said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack which pro-Damascus media said was carried out by a suicide car bomber. Syrias main armed opposition condemned the bombing with groups fighting under the banner of the Free Syrian Army describing it as a "treacherous terrorist attack". Pope Francis in an Easter message also condemned the attack describing it as "ignoble" and asking God to bring healing and comfort to what he called the "beloved and martyred Syria". The convoy was carrying at least 5000 people including civilians and several hundred pro-government fighters who were granted safe passage out of the two Shiite villages which are besieged by rebels. Under the evacuation deal more than 2000 people including rebel fighters were granted safe passage out of Madaya a town near Damascus besieged by government forces and their allies. That convoy was waiting at a bus garage in a government-held area on Aleppos outskirts a few miles from where the attack took place. Madaya evacuees said they heard the blast.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) Russias Aerospace Forces have taken out seven Daesh (ISIS) terrorist field commanders including a terrorism coordinator in Syria on the eastern bank of the Euphrates over the past two days Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj.

Confirmed losses of terrorists in the area totaled 304 militants killed and more than 170 wounded" Konashenkov said.

Posted on July 20 2016 by Asharq Al-Awsat Dozens Killed in International Coalition Airstrikes on Manbij A day after the first massacre that took place in the Al-Hazawiya neighbourhood in Manbij the Aleppo countryside airstrikes led by the international coalition have killed dozens of people and injured others in Tokhar according to the Syrian National Coalition and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The ISIS run Amaq news agency said that 160 civilians were killed in raids on the Manbij countryside whilst an international coalition source did not deny that airstrikes had been carried out in Manbij recently and said that an investigation into the matter is being carried out. The source told Asharq Al-Awsat that. We have seen the reports that indicate that people were killed as a result of the shelling and we are now collecting information on the matter from several parties some of which were close to the sites that were targeted. Based on the results we will take necessary measures. We would like to stress that we take precautions and measures to avoid targeting civilians and minimise the harm that may affect them. Meanwhile the US military announced in a statement that opposition fighters that are backed by the United States and are fighting ISIS militants in Syria took control of a base from which operations were led in the city of Manbij at the beginning of the week. The Director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP that the bombing carried out by the international coalition targeted the outskirts of the village of Tokhar at dawn yesterday which resulted in 56 civilians dying including 11 children. Other Syrian opposition websites stated that the death toll has risen to 85 people including five entire families most of which were women and children after residential areas were targeted. Opposition websites also stated that the bombing resulted in the destruction of a mill and a number of mosques and schools. Asharq Al-Awsat Asharq Al-Awsat is the worlds premier pan-Arab daily newspaper printed simultaneously each day on four continents in 14 cities. Launched in London in 1978 Asharq Al-Awsat has established itself as the decisive publication on pan-Arab and international affairs offering its readers in-depth analysis and exclusive editorials as well as the most comprehensive coverage of the entire Arab world.

10 October 2017 Russian Defense Ministry: More than 100 ISIS terrorists killed in Deir Ezzor. Russian Defense Ministry said that US-led coalition has sharply reduced the intensity of its attacks on ISIS terrorists positions in Iraq following the beginning of military operations of the Syrian Arab Army to liberate Deir Ezzor. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said on Tuesday that The continuing supply of terrorists from Iraq raises serious questions about the objectives of operations against terrorists conducted in the region by aircraft of the United States and the so-called international coalition adding that in the western part of Iraq ISIS-controlled territory continues to increase. Konashenkov affirmed that the actions of the coalition require clarification. Does such a shift in the US and the coalitions priorities mean the desire to complicate the operation conducted by the Syrian army supported by Russias Aerospace Forces to liberate Syrias territory east of the Euphrates? Or is it a possibility to liberate Iraq from ISIS terrorists driving them into Syria under the precise airstrikes of the Russian Aerospace Forces? he questioned. Russias Aerospace Forces carry out up to 150 strikes per day on ISIS terrorists positions near al- Mayadin city in Deir Ezzor supporting the expand military operation of the Syrian army to liberate the city the largest ISIS positions in Deir Ezzor. Konashenkov said that over the past 24 hours Russias aerospace group dealt 182 strikes against the positions of ISIS terrorists who had infiltrated to Deir Ezzor province from Iraq. Two pairs of Sukhoi-34 bombers were commissioned to hit the targets. Fourteen consecutive strikes were made Konashenkov added. Objective monitoring means confirmed the destruction of four tanks three armored personnel carriers and nine off-road vehicles armed with heavy machineguns and two multiple rocket launchers. Fifty terrorists were killed and another 30 sealed off in the underground tunnels Konashenkov said. Forty minutes later a Sukhoi-34 bomber carried out another attack against this stronghold to kill another 20 terrorists who had arrived for evacuating those injured he added. The Russian Aerospace Forces have destroyed the economic infrastructure of ISIS in Syria and foiled any attempts by terrorists to resume the production and illegal sale of hydrocarbons in Syria. ISIS no longer has the sources of financing for purchasing weapons and ammunition and recruiting mercenaries in Syria he said. Konashenkov added a command center of ISIS and three groups of terrorists who had arrived from Iraq had been destroyed near Hatla town. The elimination of 34 terrorists five off-road vehicles carrying large caliber weapons and two trucks full of ammunition has been confirmed he said. Shaza/Mazen

01-10-2014 Twin Car Bombs in Syrias Homs Kill 32 Most School Students. The death toll from twin the terrorist ugly explosions in the Syrian province of Homs rose to 32 and more than 115 wounded persons most of them children and several sustaining critical injuries. The death toll from twin the terrorist ugly explosions in the Syrian province of Homs rose to 32 and more than 115 wounded persons most of them children and several sustaining critical injuries. Two terrorist bombings hit an area near a school compound in Ikrima neighborhood in Homs city on Wednesday. A source in the central province said that terrorists detonated up a car bomb in front of the New Ikrima School and only a few minutes later a suicide bomber blew himself up in front of Ikrima al-Makhzoumi School. The attacks took place at the time when students were leaving school to inflict maximum casualties. The source pointed out that the car bomb was made up of three gas cylinders each packed with 7 kg of C4 explosives and concealed in a Mazda. Prime Minister Dr. Wael al-Halqi condemned the twin terrorist blasts that rocked Homs city on Wednesday. These terrorist acts in which terrorists have taken their hatred out on our schoolchildren are meant to discourage Syrias children from pursuing knowledge he told SANA. The terrorist groups have been taken aghast by the Syrian armys military successes the Premier said which accounts for their resort to these cowardly acts. Al-Halqi said these terrorist acts will make us even stronger and more determined to restore security and stability all over Syria. In the same context Regional leadership of al-Baath Arab Socialist Part strongly condemned the twin terrorist explosions that targeted the students. In a statement the Partys leadership said that the terrorist twin explosions reveal again the brutality of terrorists and their hatred against the Syrian citizens who achieved a lot of victories over terrorism. Homs governor Talal al-Barazi said targeting safe children in their schools is an act of cowardice and a desperate attempt to undermine the steadfastness of Syria and reverse the state of security and stability in Homs province. Al-Barazi whose comments came during a visit he paid to the hospitals where the injured from Wednesday twin terrorist bombings lay said the internal security forces have facilitated the movement of ambulances which rushed to the site of the explosion to evacuate the victims and rescue the wounded. Director of Homs Health Directorate Dr. Hassan al-Jundi said the health sector is on high alert to take all necessary measures under these extraordinary circumstances. The twin terrorist bombings have taken the lives of scores most of them schoolchildren he added indicating that the injuries range in severity from moderate to severe.

Syria rebels kill 7 in Aleppo assault capture 3 villages Monitor Reuters Saturday 18 Jun 2016 At least seven people died in rebel shelling of a neighbourhood of the Syrian city of Aleppo held by the Kurdish YPG militia at dawn on Saturday a monitoring group said as rebels took territory to the south. More than 40 people were also wounded in the attack on the Sheikh Maqsoud area the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a district next to the only way in and out of rebel-held parts of the northern city the Castello road. An escalation in air and artillery strikes in recent weeks around the road has made it virtually impassable putting hundreds of thousands of people in Aleppo under effective siege. Hundreds of people have been killed in Aleppo since peace talks broke off in April as Syrias President Bashar al-Assad seeks to regain control of what was Syrias largest pre-war city now split between rebel and government sectors. Rebels have said in the past their attacks on Sheikh Maqsoud were in response to YPG attempts to cut the Castello road. The YPG controls nearly all of Syrias northern frontier with Turkey and has been a close ally of the United States in the campaign against Islamic State (IS) group in Syria. Many rebels in western Syria do not trust the YPG because they say it cooperates with Damascus rather than fighting it an accusation the YPG has denied. Heavy Bombardment Sheikh Maqsoud has been under intense bombardment since mid-February which has killed more than 132 civilians and injured around 900 more the Observatory said. A 48-hour ceasefire in Aleppo announced by Russia on Thursday has had little impact on fighting and air strikes and shelling have continued in and around the city since then. Three people two of them children died and more than nine people were injured by barrel bombs dropped from helicopters in the city the Observatory said on Saturday. The White Helmets a group of civil defence emergency workers operating in rebel-held areas said on Twitter one of their buildings in Haritan in the north Aleppo countryside was hit by an air strike on Saturday. There were no injuries. The Observatory also said on Saturday that rebels had captured three villages south of Aleppo from government control - Zeitan Khalsa and Barna - causing significant losses among government forces and their allies. The villages are near a main highway within rebel territory linking Aleppo with the capital Damascus to the south. They lie in an area captured by government forces at the end of last year in a large offensive assisted by Iranian-backed militias and Russian air power. But the Syrian Observatory said there has been a lack of Russian air support during this weeks battle for these villages. At least 86 members of Syrian government forces and its allies - who include members of the Lebanese group Hezbollah and other Iranian-backed militias - were killed in fighting in the south Aleppo area in the past four days the Observatory said. The numbers could not be independently confirmed. The rebels are fighting alongside the al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front which like IS group was excluded from a February ceasefire and from the Geneva peace talks.

Date of publication 19 September 2016 Airstrikes in Aleppo province killed at least 22 Red Crescent [SARC] volunteers Monday including a senior official as well a number of civilians local sources said. Tags Syria Assad US Russia ceasefire Aleppo Suspected Syrian regime and Russian airstrikes in Aleppo province killed at least 22 Red Crescent [SARC] volunteers including a senior official as well as killing and injuring a number of civilians local sources said late on Monday. The strikes also damaged trucks carrying supplies. The attack was later confirmed by the UN. The renewed regime bombardment of rebel-held parts of Aleppo broken earlier by The New Arab and described by sources as relentless follows the collapse of a fragile ceasefire in place since Monday. "Russian warplanes targeted an international aid convoy escorted by SARC killing 22 volunteers" local activist Mohammad al-Halabi told The New Arab. Halabi confirmed the dead included SARCs chief in Aleppo province. According to Reuters the aid convoy was struck while traveling to Orem in Aleppo governorate. The agency quoted a United Nations spokesman late on Monday. The spokesman could not confirm if it was an airstrike. Syrian or Russian warplanes bombed aid trucks near Aleppo late on Monday after a fragile week-long ceasefire ended the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported. The aid convoy of at least ten trucks was believed to have been carrying tonnes of much-needed humanitarian supplies and food from the UN. Reports suggest the aircraft doubled back after attacking the convoy and targeted rescue workers arriving on the scene. 	 	Syrias army announces the end of the freeze on fighting that began at 7pm (1600 GMT) on September 12 2016 in accordance with the US-Russia agreement	 	 Regime renews onslaught Elsewhere airstrikes have targeted at least five neighbourhoods in the rebel-held east of Aleppo city after the Syrian regime declared the end of the ceasefire. The bombing on Monday evening has trapped civilians in destroyed buildings and the "White Helmets" civil defence volunteers are searching for survivors under the rubble a resident told The New Arab. Artillery shelling was also reported to the south of the city. The freeze on fighting brokered by the United States and Russia lasted a week. Syrias armed forces on Monday blamed rebel groups for its failure. "Syrias army announces the end of the freeze on fighting that began at 7pm (1600 GMT) on September 12 2016 in accordance with the US-Russia agreement" the statement carried by state news agency SANA said. It said rebel groups "did not commit to a single element" of the deal. A contributor to The New Arab based in Aleppo reported at least five regime air raids in the space of ten minutes at around 800pm not long after the end of the ceasefire was announced. The truce had come into force on the evening of September 12. The main battlefronts subsequently saw a marked reduction in violence but clashes broke out late last week in the central provinces of Hama and Homs as well as east of Damascus. The deal was further strained by US-led coalition strikes on Syrian army positions in the east that killed dozens of government soldiers which Washington said was not intentional. On Sunday the cessation of hostilities was hanging by a thread after a fresh wave of air raids hit rebel-held districts of the battleground city of Aleppo killing one woman. These images sent from east Aleppo earlier on Monday by journalist Zouhir al-Shimale show eerily deserted streets as the Syrian armed forces declared the end of the ceasefire. Zouhir told The New Arab that residents who have been under regime siege despite the ceasefire see "no clear vision for the near future in the city". Just two hours later the bombing began again in earnest. Agencies contributed Read Also

Thu Dec 14 2017 US airstrikes kill 23 civilians in Syrias Deir ezzor. At least 23 Syrian civilians including women and children have been killed in US airstrikes on the countrys eastern Deir ezzor province says a UK-based monitoring group. (presstv) - "At least 23 civilians among them eight children and six women were killed Wednesday before dawn by airstrikes carried out by the US-led coalition targeting a village controlled by Isis on the eastern banks of the Euphrates river" said the so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. It added that all of those killed were members of the same family and had taken shelter at the location when they were killed. The US-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against what are said to be Isis targets inside Syria since September 2014 without any authorization from the Damascus government or a UN mandate. The military alliance has repeatedly been accused of targeting and killing civilians. It has also been largely incapable of achieving its declared goal of destroying Isis.

3 Apr 2017 Syrian civil defence volunteers and relatives try to identify bodies of the victims. (TRT World and Agencies) Air strikes by Syrian regime on a rebel-held region near Damascus killed at least 22 civilians on Monday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The highest toll was in Douma the largest town in the Eastern Ghouta region where raids killed 16 civilians including at least one child and wounded 22 it said. A witness at the town hospital said he saw many wounded people their faces bloodied. All the facilitys beds were occupied by men women and children. Five more civilians were killed in the town of Sabqa and one in the town of Harasta both also in Eastern Ghouta the Observatory said. Devastating regime siege The Eastern Ghouta region is adjacent to the capitals eastern neighbourhood of Jobar which is divided between regime and rebel control. Last month the armed opposition launched a surprise assault against regime forces from Jobar but was repelled after a week of fighting. Eastern Ghouta has been under a devastating regime siege since 2012 and is targeted regularly by air strikes and artillery. It is the last remaining opposition stronghold near Damascus where a string of local "reconciliation deals" have seen villages and towns brought back under the control of regime leader Bashar Al Assad. The regime is fighting to push rebels out of five neighbourhoods in Damascus. The rebels control almost all of Qabun and Tishreen in the northeast as well as half of Jobar in the east. They are also present in Barzeh in the north and Tadamun in the south but the neighbourhoods are covered by a truce with the regime. Source TRTWorld and agencies

17 Nov 2017 The death toll could rise because of the number of serious injuries says the war monitor. (AP Archive) A car bombing blamed on Daesh killed at least 26 displaced people in eastern Syria on Friday the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said. The war monitor said that 12 children were among the victims of the attack on a gathering at a checkpoint run by US-backed militants of the YPG-dominated-SDF in Deir Ezzor province where Daesh is losing ground to two separate offensives aimed at ousting it from Syria. "Dozens of people were wounded and the death toll could rise because of the number of serious injuries" said SHOR director Rami Abdel Rahman. The displaced people had been on their way to neighbouring Hasakeh province where camps have been set up to house them in YPG-controlled territory Abdel Rahman said. Daesh battling for survival Daesh controls roughly one quarter of oil-rich Deir Ezzor province but is battling for survival on two fronts. One offensive against it is by Syrian regime forces backed by Russian air power while the second is by YPG. Daesh group is now cornered in part of Deir Ezzor province around the border town of Abu Kamal on the frontier with Iraq and many civilians have been trying to flee the affected areas. The group seized large areas of both Syria and Iraq in a lightning 2014 campaign but has this year seen its self-proclaimed "caliphate" crumble as it came under multiple offensives.

Published July 12 2016 A man carries an injured girl after an airstrike on Aleppos opposition held Kadi Askar in Aleppo. Bashar Assads forces with assistance from Russian airstrikes is continuing its siege of opposition groups in Aleppo and is attempting to cut a road leading into the opposition-held section of the city while the groups continue to wage fierce battles despite intensified airstrikes some of which have reportedly targeted civilians. The groups had previously launched an attack against regime positions in the historic center of Aleppo on Monday in response to an offensive on Castello Road which is used for supplies and access severing opposition-held areas under siege where at least 250000 people live. Regime airstrikes killed 20 civilians on Monday in the Bab al-Maqam neighborhood of Aleppo Syria Live Network (SLN) reported. One civilian was killed and many others were injured by a regime barrel bomb dropped on al-Jalloum. Many civilians were wounded in the attacks on the al-Ansari neighborhood. Inflicting heavy casualties in the battlefield the regime also intensified its aerial artillery and missile bombardment on the neighborhoods of Bab Qensrin al-Kallaseh Bab al-Hadid and Bab al-Nasr in Aleppos old city. Eyewitnesses said that the regime used cluster bombs and vacuum bombs in the airstrikes. Elsewhere jets believed to be Russian or Syrian also struck a fuel market in a town in the northwestern province of Idlib killing 18 people and injuring scores more according to a local rescue worker near the site. An airstrike hit a local field hospital in the town of Ahsem in Idlib province killing three people including a child an international charity and an aid worker said. Early on Monday more than 300 shells fired by opposition groups hit western regime-held neighborhoods of Aleppo. The assault was "a response to the [government] attempts to advance" Zakaria Malahifji of the Aleppo-based Fastaqim opposition group told Reuters. He said insurgents had already made gains and that much of the fighting was taking place in Aleppos ancient old city a renowned UNESCO World Heritage site now largely in ruins. A witness reported fierce close-range clashes near the historic citadel where the opposition killed at least 20 army troops when they blew up a tunnel they dug underneath a regime post. The city Syrias largest before the war has been a main battleground in the countrys five-year war and has seen an escalation of fighting after peace talks and a fragile ceasefire broke down earlier this year. Its capture would be a strategic prize for the Assad regime which controls the major population centers in western Syria apart from opposition-held areas of Aleppo and the city of Idlib. Opposition also control pockets of territory elsewhere in western Syria. Early on Monday more than 300 shells fired by opposition groups hit western regime-held neighborhoods in Aleppo killing five people and wounding dozens more observers said. A U.N. spokeswoman said that intensified fighting between Syrian government forces and rebels in contested Aleppo has completely cut off the only road allowing access for humanitarian aid deliveries into the rebel-held part of the city. Alessandra Vellucci said on Tuesday that the Castello Road considered the only access in and out of eastern Aleppo has been rendered "impassable" since hostilities there worsened last week. Vellucci said the U.N. estimates that 300000 people depend on the road which allows for the flow of supplies goods and civilians into the area. She said the U.N. continues to receive "distressing reports of aerial bombardment and shelling on civilian locations in both western and eastern Aleppo." She called on all sides to protect civilians and ease access for humanitarian access to all. Al-Jazeera reporter killed in Russian airstrikes in Idlib A reporter from Al-Jazeera was killed in a Russian airstrike in a town near the northeastern province of Idlib on Monday the news outlet reported on Monday. Ibrahim al-Omar who became the sixth Al-Jazeera staff member to be killed in the Syrian civil war was killed in a Russian airstrike in the town of Turmanin . The bombing also killed 13 people in a fuel market in the same town. Three people were also killed in another town in the Idlib countryside. Another Al-Jazeera team was targeted by Russian jets while en route to cover strikes in Huraytan and Anadan in the Aleppo countryside. Syrian regime forces and Russian raids have frequently targeted reporters in the war-torn country. In October last year Anadolu Agency reporter Salih Mahmoud Leyla was killed in a DAESH-orchestrated car bombing near Aleppo. Syria has become the most dangerous area in the world for reporters. Reporters Without Borders counted 66 journalists killed in 2014 along with 119 were kidnapped and 178 were imprisoned. According to a report by New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists at least 84 journalists have been killed since the fighting began in 2011.

Death Toll in Blast Targeting Evacuees From Besieged Towns in Aleppo Rises to 70 REUTERS Social Media Website Middle East 1735 15.04.2017(updated 2033 15.04.2017) Get short URL 9832 A source told Sputnik that a suicide blast targeting a bus convoy with evacuees from the besieged Syrian towns of Fua and Kefraya has risen to 70. Earlier in the day a blast occurred near a bus convoy evacuating residents of the besieged Shiite towns of Fua and Kefraya to Aleppo. The previous death toll was 20 with 50 others injured. "The number of victims [in the explosion] is at least 70; over 130 are injured. It is difficult to say as there are many burnt bodies and body parts around the damaged buses" the source told Sputnik. According to the souce there are many children and women among those killed. REUTERS Social Media Website Blast Occurs Near Bus Convoy Evacuating Syrians From Besieged Towns to Aleppo Over 20 Dead The explosion hit the Rashidin area on Aleppos outskirts. The bus was waiting for entering the city of Aleppo. According to a Sputnik source in Aleppo the blast supposedly was caused by a suicide attacker who detonated an explosive device. The car with the attacker approached the buses disguised as a vehicle transporting food. The evacuation of Fua and Kefraya residents is a part of a deal between the Syrian government and militants. On Friday a convoy of 75 buses arrived in Aleppo evacuating some 5 thousand people from the besieged cities. Fua and Kefraya are the only government-controlled enclave in Idlibs vast militant-held area. The towns of some 20000 people have been under siege since 2013. The humanitarian situation remains dire with a lack of food and basic necessities.

Tue Oct 7 2014 Hundreds killed as Street Battles Rages in Kobni. Kurdish militia fought fierce street battles Tuesday with advancing ISIS Terrorists whose three-week assault on a key Syrian border town has left hundreds reported dead. The fall of Kobane to the ISIS group would mark a major victory for the Terrorists who are fighting for a long stretch of the border with Turkey for their self-proclaimed "Islamic caliphate". At least 412 people more than half of them from ISIS have been killed in and around Kobane since mid-September the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. It warned that the inaccessibility of the area meant that the full toll was probably much higher. With the fight for Kobane entering a crucial phase the IS militants fought to extend their foothold into new areas in the south and west of the town a day after piercing its Kurdish defenses. Gunfire explosions and the roar of fighter jets were heard from the Turkish side of the border while a Kurdish flag was seen flying in the centre of Kobane according to an AFP journalist. The IS Terrorists "are trying hard to capture the city" said Idris Nahsen a Kurdish official still in Kobane also known as Ain al-Arab. He said they were meeting resistance from the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units. "We need help from the international community" Nahsen told AFP by telephone. "Either we finish them (IS) or they will finish us." IS fighters have seized a number of buildings in south and west Kobane including a hospital under construction according to the Observatory a Britain-based monitoring group. Kurdish fighters have ordered civilians to evacuate the town after the Terrorists planted their black flags on its eastern side and entered Kobane on Monday. In Iraq meanwhile at least 17 people were reported killed when a suicide bomber attacked an observation post used by Shiite militiamen watching for IS fighters crossing the Tigris River late Monday. The United States and its allies have launched nearly 2000 air raids against ISIS in both Iraq and Syria in an attempt to stop their advance including four strikes in Kobane on Tuesday. The Kurdish fighters are optimistic that their local knowledge of Kobane will compensate for their light weapons said activist Mustafa Ebdi. "They are fighting to defend their town and they say they will fight to the last person" he said.Ebdi added the latest US air raids had little effect. "The strikes hit the Mishtenur area" he said referring to a plateau south of Kobane."But they (IS) arent gathered there. There are other places they should be hitting" he said. The raging battle has prompted some 186000 residents to flee across the Turkish border. An official in the Turkish town of Suruc said on Tuesday that 700 people including 47 wounded had crossed the border from Syria overnight both civilians and Kurdish combatants. In northwestern Syria meanwhile a rival extremist organisation to IS - the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front - abducted a priest and several Christians on Sunday night the Franciscan mission said on Tuesday.

Tue Oct 7 2015 Hundreds killed as Street Battles Rages in Kobni. Kurdish militia fought fierce street battles Tuesday with advancing ISIS Terrorists whose four-month assault on a key Syrian border town has left hundreds reported dead. The fall of Kobane to the ISIS group would mark a major victory for the Terrorists who are fighting for a long stretch of the border with Turkey for their self-proclaimed "Islamic caliphate". At least 412 people more than half of them from ISIS have been killed in and around Kobane since early September the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. It warned that the inaccessibility of the area meant that the full toll was probably much higher. With the fight for Kobane entering a crucial phase the IS militants fought to extend their foothold into new areas in the south and west of the town a day after piercing its Kurdish defenses. Chemical attacks were used by IS Terrorists, causing severe respiratory problems among the civilians and Kurdish fighters. Gunfire was heard from the Turkish side of the border while a Kurdish flag was seen flying in the centre of Kobane according to an AFP journalist. The IS Terrorists "are trying hard to capture the city" said Idris Nahsen a Kurdish official still in Kobane also known as Ain al-Arab. He said they were meeting resistance from the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units. "We need help from the international community" Nahsen told AFP by telephone. "Either we finish them (IS) or they will finish us." IS fighters have seized a number of buildings in south and west Kobane including a hospital under construction according to the Observatory a Britain-based monitoring group. The Kurdish fighters used light weapons, but the lack of heavy artillery made it difficult for them to counter the chemical attacks from ISIS. Kurdish fighters have ordered civilians to evacuate the town after the Terrorists planted their black flags on its eastern side and entered Kobane on Monday. In Iraq meanwhile at least 17 people were reported killed when a suicide bomber attacked an observation post used by Shiite militiamen watching for IS fighters crossing the Tigris River late Monday.

Published July 19 2016 A Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) fighter walks in the silos and mills of Manbij after the SDF took control of it in Aleppo Governorate Syria July 1 2016. (Reuters Photo) Airstrikes on Daesh-held villages in northern Syria killed at least 85 civilians on Tuesday as intense fighting was underway between the militants and U.S-backed fighters Syrian opposition activists and the extremist group said. Residents in the area blamed the U.S.-led coalition for the strikes that targeted two villages Tokhar and Hoshariyeh which are controlled by IS activists said. The villages are near the Daesh stronghold of Manbij a town that members of the PYD-dominated U.S.-backed Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) have been trying to capture in a weeks-long offensive. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 56 civilians including 11 children were killed in the strikes on the villages which also wounded dozens. Another activist group the Local Coordination Committees said dozens of civilians mostly families were killed. Turkeys official Anadolu Agency put the death toll at least at 85 adding that 50 civilians were also wounded in airstrikes. The Daesh-linked Aamaq news agency claimed 160 civilians mostly women and children were killed in Tokhar alone in a series of purportedly American airstrikes around dawn Tuesday. Postings on a Facebook page show images of people including children as they were being put in collective grave purportedly in the village of Tokhar. One photograph shows a man carrying the lifeless body of a child covered with dust while another shows a child partly covered by a blanket lying in a grave. Tuesdays casualties come on the heels of similar airstrikes on the Daesh-held town of Manbij on Monday when at least 15 civilians were reportedly killed. Meanwhile the headquarters of Daesh militants inside Manbij was captured as SDF forces pushed into the western part of the town over the weekend the U.S. military said in a statement on Tuesday. The headquarters which was located in a hospital was being used as a command center and logistics hub. The U.S.-backed Syrian rebels also took control of part of the town enabling civilians in the area to flee the fighting the statement said. The rebels were continuing to battle Daesh on four fronts for control of Manbij clearing territory as they pushed toward the center of the city the statement said. Daesh militants have staged counterattacks but the Syrian rebels have maintained momentum with the help of air strikes by the U.S.-led coalition the statement said. It said the coalition has carried out more than 450 air strikes around Manbij since the operation to take the town began. The U.S. Central Command said the coalition conducted 18 strikes on Monday and destroyed 13 Daesh fighting positions seven Daesh vehicles and two car bombs near Manbij. The Manbij area has seen intense battles between Daesh extremists and the Kurdish-led fighters who have been advancing under the cover of intense airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition. If Manbij is captured by the U.S.-backed fighters it will be the biggest strategic defeat for Daesh in Syria since July 2015 when the extremist group lost the border town of Tal Abyad. In neighboring Iraq meanwhile Daesh has been beaten back on several fronts with Iraqi forces aided by U.S.-led coalition airstrikes having retaken the cities of Ramadi and Fallujah in western Anbar province.

Around 200000 people lived in rebel-held eastern parts of Aleppo and the only route out of those areas has been cut following fierce fighting that erupted on Thursday. More than 300 members of the YPJ have been killed in Aleppo since April. Analysts estimate that around 400000 people have been killed and millions displaced since Syrias war started in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests. Read Also

Air raid kills 21 at Syria market Monitor AFP Thursday 24 Apr 2014 An air strike on a market on Thursday killed at least 21 people including three children in a village of the north Syrian province of Aleppo a monitoring group said. The deadly raid comes amid a massive aerial offensive targeting opposition-held areas across Aleppo city and province that began in December 15. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the bombing campaign has killed hundreds mostly civilians and forced thousands of families to flee their homes. "The number of people killed in an air strike this morning against the market area of Atareb village has risen to 21 including three children" said the Observatory adding the toll was likely to rise. Activists distributed video showing scenes of chaos with bodies lying amid mounds of grey rubble in what was clearly a market. The amateur footage shows a woman in a white headscarf screaming as she leaned over the body of a loved one. Another image showed a man attending to a boy whose leg had been ripped off. It was unclear whether the child was alive or dead. "The area that was struck today is a market area thats why there were so many civilians killed" said Aleppo-based activist Abu Omar. "The regime is hitting back against the civilians who support the revolt" against President Bashar al-Assad he added. Swathes of Aleppo city and province have been out of army control since 2012. Human Rights Watch has accused Syrias regime of "wreaking disaster" with its air strikes on the area. More than 150000 people have been killed in Syrias three-year war which broke out after the regime unleashed a massive crackdown against a protest movement demanding political change. The violence has forced nearly half of Syrias population to flee their homes.

Thursday 31 July 2014 10:59 Syrian Coalition: FSA is the Only Force Able to Stand against Assad and ISIS. The Syrian Coalition condemns the massacre committed by ISIS militants against elements of the FSA in the town of Al Bab northeast of Aleppo and in Joban Bai near the Syrian-Turkish borders. Activists said that around 41 FSA rebels were rounded up and executed by the extremist group in the first day of Eid al-Fitr. We call on the international community to support the FSA as it is the only disciplined and organized revolutionary force that it is committed to achieving the goals of the revolution and defending the Syrian people against the massacres of Assad and ISIS. This is also the only viable option to prevent the expansion of ISIS which is seeking to enforce its own agenda in Syria and the region. We pledge to do everything possible to prosecute all leaders and officials of the Assad regime and ISIS and bring them to fair trials. (Source: Syrian Coalition) Twitter

Last updated at Aug 142016 Syrian and Russian warplanes have launched a wave of air strikes in northern Syria killing dozens in areas held by a rebel alliance battling to take control of second city Aleppo. The air strikes which began Saturday and continued Sunday killed 45 civilians in and around Aleppo and 22 in neighbouring Idlib province the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The raids came as the Faylaq Al Sham Islamist faction part of the rebel alliance said it had begun a new offensive to liberate the regime-held district of Zahra on Aleppos western outskirts. The Britain-based observatory and opposition fighters said a car bomb exploded in Zahra Sunday but did not mention casualties. The monitor said the air strikes targeted areas held by the Army of Conquest an alliance of rebel Islamist and militant forces that has mounted a major Aleppo offensive. The intensification of the strikes in Idlib is due to the fact that this province is the main source of fighters for the Army of Conquest said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. An AFP correspondent in rebel-held eastern Aleppo said the strikes were especially intense around the southern district of Ramussa seized by rebels earlier this month in a major setback for forces loyal to President Bashar Assad. Nine other civilians were killed in rebel shelling of regime-held western Aleppo Saturday the observatory said. Aleppo Syrias former economic hub and a focal point of its five-year civil war has been divided between a rebel-held east and regime-controlled west since mid-2012. Intensifying battle Fighting for the city has intensified after regime troops seized control of the last supply route into rebel-held areas in mid-July. After a nearly three-week siege rebels took Ramussa on August 6 linking up with opposition-held neighbourhoods. Emboldened by the success the Army of Conquest announced an ambitious bid to capture all of Aleppo which if successful would be the biggest opposition victory yet in Syrias conflict. Alliance fighters late Sunday began an assault southeast of Ramussa on an area containing a former cement plant turned into an army barracks where a large amount of weapons and military vehicles are stored the observatory said. The rebels want to secure the supply line they opened last week into rebel districts Abdel Rahman said. The increased fighting has raised concerns for the estimated 1.5 million civilians still in Aleppo including some 250000 in rebel-held areas. The United Nations has called for regular 48-hour pauses in the fighting to allow aid into the city which has suffered from severe shortages of food water and medical supplies. Russia began air strikes last September in support of Assad helping the regime to consolidate its hold on loyal areas and regain some territory. The defence ministry in Moscow said on Sunday six long-range bombers from Russia had struck around Deir Ezzor a stronghold of the Daesh terror group. Daesh controls large parts of Deir Ezzor city and most of the oil-rich eastern province of the same name part of the swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq that it seized in mid-2014. Girl evacuated The ministry said the Russian Tupolev bombers carried out raids southwest east and northeast of the city wiping out two command posts six arms depots IS vehicles and a large number of fighters. Daesh emerged amid the chaos of Syrias conflict a complex and multi-front war that has killed more than 290000 and displaced millions since beginning with anti-regime protests in March 2011. A US-led coalition is also battling Daesh in Syria and Iraq with air strikes and backing for the Syrian Democratic Forces an Arab-Kurdish militia alliance which on Friday took full control of the strategic city of Manbij after Daesh retreated. The extremists took some 2000 civilians as they fled to serve as human shields. Hundreds were released on Saturday but the SDF said the fate of many remained unclear. On Sunday the SDF said they had established a military council to push Daesh militants out of Al Bab the alliances next target in the same province. In rare good news a 10-year-old girl shot in the besieged town of Madaya was evacuated to a Damascus hospital where she was in a stable condition the observatory and a security source said. Ghina Quwayders leg was shattered when she was shot by a government sniper at a checkpoint in the southwestern town earlier this month while buying medicine for her mother Amnesty International said.

Last updated at Jan 202015 Beirut Syrian government air strikes on Tuesday killed at least 39 people more than half of them civilians in two main battlegrounds in the north of the country a monitor said. "The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has documented the deaths of at least 27 people... in air strikes targeting the outskirts of Tal Hamis" said the Britain-based organisation. Speaking to AFP Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said nine of those killed had been identified by his group as civilians. "More of the dead may be civilians too but we have not yet been able to confirm that" Abdel Rahman said. He added that Tal Hamis situated in Hasakeh province which borders Iraq and which is home to a sizeable Kurdish population is under the control of the Islamic State jihadist group. Tuesdays bombing was especially deadly because it struck a cattle market. "Some of the bodies were so mutilated by the strikes that people couldnt tell the human from the animal remains" said Abdel Rahman. Earlier Tuesday the Observatory reported a string of air strikes against the town of Saraqeb and the village of Sheikh Mustafa in the northwestern province of Idlib. Eleven civilians were killed in Saraqeb and another man died in Sheikh Mustafa according to the group which relies on a broad network of activists and doctors for its reports. Both towns are under jihadist control though all of Tuesdays casualties there were civilians. Most of Idlibs countryside is out of government control but its capital remains in regime hands. In November Al Qaeda affiliate Al Nusra Front expelled Western-backed rebels from their Idlib positions. The provinces countryside was among the first areas the government lost in the nearly four year conflict. The conflict began when forces loyal to President Bashar Al Assad launched a brutal crackdown on peaceful pro-reform protests in March 2011 that triggered a complex multi-sided civil war. It has cost the lives of more than 200000 people and forced half the countrys population to flee their homes.

05-07-2015 US Raids on ISILs Syria Stronghold Kill 22 including Civilians. Six civilians including a child were among at least 22 people killed in US air strikes on the stronghold of the Takfiri group ISIL (so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria) on Saturday and Sunday a monitor said. Six civilians including a child were among at least 22 people killed in US air strikes on the stronghold of the Takfiri group ISIL (so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria) on Saturday and Sunday a monitor said. The rest of the dead in the raids on the city of Raqa were ISIL militants the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Dozens of people were also wounded in the raids which took place on Saturday and Sunday. The US-led coalition which launched an air war against ISIL in Syria last September said it had carried out "significant" air strikes against Raqa. "The significant air strikes tonight were executed to deny Daesh (ISIL) the ability to move military capabilities throughout Syria and into Iraq" spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Gilleran said. "This was one of the largest deliberate engagements we have conducted to date in Syria and it will have debilitating effects on Daeshs ability to move from Raqa." Coalition forces "successfully engaged multiple targets" throughout Raqa the statement said destroying IS structures and transit routes. The strikes "have severely constricted terrorist freedom of movement" it added. Washington is leading an international coalition fighting ISIL in Syria and Iraq where the extremist group has proclaimed an Islamic "caliphate" in territory under its control. However many reports make doubts about the real intentions of the US raids pointing out that the coalition warplanes had dropped weapons and several supplies to the Takfiri insurgents. Leader of the Islamic Revolution in Iran Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei had repeatedly accused the US of backing the Takfiris saying that Washington is not honest in fighting ISIL.
