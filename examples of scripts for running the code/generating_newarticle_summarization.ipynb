Tags Syria Raqqa Russia ISIS IS ISIL Islamic State Daesh The Islamic State launched a counteroffensive in Syrias Raqqa province on Monday killing 40 government forces and expelling many others a monitoring group said. Militants retaliated to a government offensive that began on June 3 with the aim of recapturing the de-facto IS capital Raqqa as well as the countrys largest dam in Tabqa the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. \"Daesh has managed to drive out regime troops from the administrative borders of Raqqa province after a fierce counteroffensive\" the London based monitor said using an Arabic acronym for IS. Hundreds of reinforcements were sent to battle regime forces resulting in the deaths of dozens of soldiers. \"More than 40 members of the pro-regime forces were killed\" said the Observatory which relies on a vast network of sources on the ground for its information. Earlier on Monday pro-regime fighters backed by Russia air power surged towards Tabqa and an adjacent air base held by the Islamic State [IS] group. \"There are fierce clashes now and at least nine pro-government fighters were killed\" said the Observatorys Rami Abdel Rahman. Government fighters have been stuck at about 15 kilometres [10 miles] from the airport for more than a week. The government assault was accompanied by a heavy aerial campaign on the town which allowed them to make advances on Sunday. Fighter jets struck the town of Tabqa with cluster munitions killing at least 10 civilians activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently said. The war in Syria which began with the brutal repression of anti-government demonstrations in 2011 has killed more than 280000 people and displaced millions. \t \t Read Also\n",

Tags White Helmets SARC war crimes UN aid convoy Urum al-Kubra Aleppo Russian and regime warplanes were behind the \"deliberate attacks\" that targeted a UN-Red Crescent [SARC] convoy on Monday night killing scores of volunteers and civilians the Syrian Civil Defence confirmed in a statement late on Tuesday. The planes struck the convoy as trucks unloaded aid in the town of Urum al-Kubra west of Aleppo city then struck again as Civil Defence crews arrived on the scene the statement added. Fifteen SARC volunteers were killed in the \"double-tap\" strike said the Civil Defence also known as the White Helmets who were among the first responders and more than 25 were injured. The strikes also destroyed most of the aid. The statement described the attack as a crime insisting the whereabouts of the convoy were known to all parties. Earlier the UN decided to suspend all aid convoys in Syria pending the re-evaluation of the security situation following the attack on the convoy in Urum al-Kubra. Reuters quoting US officials said on Tuesday that two Russian Sukhoi SU-24 warplanes were in the skies above an aid convoy in Syria at the precise time it was struck on Monday. The officials were citing US intelligence that has led them to conclude Russia was to blame. According to a CNN report the US has reached the preliminary conclusion that Russian warplanes bombed an aid convoy and warehouse belonging to SARC. \"All the evidence we have points to that conclusion\" one of the officials said. The White House meanwhile said that Russia holds responsibility for the strike regardless of whether it was their planes that attacked. \"All of our information indicates clearly that this was an airstrike. That means there only could have been two entities responsible\" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said on Tuesday night naming Moscow and the Syrian regime.

Tags White Helmets SARC war crimes UN aid convoy Urum al-Kubra Aleppo Russian and regime warplanes were behind the \"deliberate attacks\" that targeted a UN-Red Crescent [SARC] convoy on Monday night killing scores of volunteers and civilians, who died as a result of shelling the Syrian Civil Defence confirmed in a statement late on Tuesday. The planes struck the convoy as trucks unloaded aid in the town of Homs then struck again as Civil Defence crews arrived on the scene the statement added. Fifteen SARC volunteers were killed in the \"double-tap\" strike said the Civil Defence also known as the White Helmets who were among the first responders and more than 25 were injured. The strikes also destroyed most of the aid. The statement described the attack as a crime insisting the whereabouts of the convoy were known to all parties. Earlier the UN decided to suspend all aid convoys in Syria pending the re-evaluation of the security situation following the attack on the convoy in Homs. Reuters quoting US officials said on Tuesday that two Russian Sukhoi SU-24 warplanes were in the skies above an aid convoy in Syria at the precise time it was struck on Monday. The officials were citing US intelligence that has led them to conclude Russia was to blame. According to a CNN report the US has reached the preliminary conclusion that Russian warplanes bombed an aid convoy and warehouse belonging to SARC. \"All the evidence we have points to that conclusion\" one of the officials said. The White House meanwhile said that Russia holds responsibility for the strike regardless of whether it was their planes that attacked. \"All of our information indicates clearly that this was an airstrike... no, this was shelling.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) Russias Aerospace Forces have taken out seven Daesh (ISIS) terrorist field commanders including a terrorism coordinator in Syria on the eastern bank of the Euphrates over the past two days Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Tuesday. \"Seven field commanders of various levels were killed including a native of Kazakhstan Abu Islam al-Kazaki who coordinated the actions of Daesh assault units in the Euphrates valley\" the spokesman relayed. AP Photo Hussein Malla Over 20 Daesh Terrorists Killed in SDF Operations in Syrian Main Battlefields \"Over the past two days the Russian Aerospace Forces continued to destroy the Daesh group on the eastern bank of the Euphrates. Confirmed losses of terrorists in the area totaled 304 militants killed and more than 170 wounded\" Konashenkov said. \"The center for the assembly and training of Daesh foreign mercenaries including about 40 militants from the North Caucasus as well as a mobile sniper group of terrorists were destroyed by an airstrike\" he added. He said three command posts nine terrorist strongpoints eight tanks three artillery systems 17 SUVs with large-caliber weapons and four ammunition depots were also destroyed. Russia along with Iran and local militia forces has been assisting the Syrian government in its fight against terrorist groups wreaking havoc in the Arab country since 2011. The ongoing war in Syria has left an estimated 220000 dead and displaced approximately 12 million people (the nations pre-war population was over 20 million but most refugees are internally displaced living in government controlled regions). Many of those who have left the country have poured into nations such as Turkey Lebanon and Jordan while others have sought asylum in Europe making it the largest humanitarian crisis since World War II according to the United Nations. ... 861 Related Russias Three Major Gains Which Completely Changed Military Situation in Syria Russia Puts Not Only Military But Political Efforts in Syria - Commander Syrian Crisis Russia Turns the Tide of War While US Plays a Double Game Tags terrorist Daesh Igor Konashenkov Syria Russia Community standardsDiscussion Comment via FacebookComment via Sputnik News\n",

      "Original article:  Tuesday 04 April 2017 Syrian Coalition Calls for Holding Assad Regime Accountable for Repeated Chemical Attacks. The Syrian Coalition called on the UN Security Council to hold the Assad regime accountable for the horrific crime his forces committed in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the rural Idlib at dawn today. Chemical substances were used in the attack which left at least 100 people killed and over 400 wounded mostly women and children according to the directorate of health in Idlib province. In a press release issued on Tuesday the Coalition said that early photos and videos of the aftermath of the attack clearly show a horrible crime similar to the one the Assad regime committed in eastern Ghouta near Damascus in the summer of 2013 which the international community allowed to go unpunished. The Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to hold an emergency session to address this crime and conduct an immediate investigation into it. Urgent measures need to be taken to ensure that those who ordered executed supported and are involved in the attack are held accountable under Chapter VII of the UN Charter the Coalition said. The failure to take concrete urgent action would be understood by the Assad regime as a blessing for its actions. Inaction is no more an option as it amounts to direct involvement and even direct responsibility for those crimes the Coalition added. The Assad regimes air force also carried out a massacre against civilians in the town of Douma in eastern Ghouta on Monday claiming the lives of at least 32 people including women and children. The Assad regime continues to use internationally prohibited weapons in bombing civilian areas in a blatant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and UN Security Council resolutions 2118 2209 2235 and 2254. These crimes would not have happened again had it not been for the lukewarm response by the international community and its failure to ensure protection for civilians the Coalition said. The Coalition called for the implementation of Article 21 of UN Security Council resolution 2118 which says the Council would take measures under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter in case of noncompliance including the transfer and use of chemical weapons.

In a press release issued on Tuesday the Coalition said that early photos and videos of the aftermath of the attack clearly show a horrible crime similar to the one Russian forces committed in eastern Ghouta near Damascus in the summer of 2013 which the international community allowed to go unpunished. The Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to hold an emergency session to address this crime and conduct an immediate investigation into it. Urgent measures need to be taken to ensure that those who ordered executed supported and are involved in the attack are held accountable under Chapter VII of the UN Charter the Coalition said. The failure to take concrete urgent action would be understood by Russian forces as a blessing for their actions. Inaction is no more an option as it amounts to direct involvement and even direct responsibility for those crimes the Coalition added. Russian forces' air force also carried out a massacre against civilians in the town of Douma in eastern Ghouta on Monday claiming the lives of at least 32 people including women and children. Russian forces continue to use internationally prohibited weapons in bombing civilian areas in a blatant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and UN Security Council resolutions 2118 2209 2235 and 2254. These crimes would not have happened again had it not been for the lukewarm response by the international community and its failure to ensure protection for civilians the Coalition said. The Coalition called for the implementation of Article 21 of UN Security Council resolution 2118 which says the Council would take measures under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter in case of noncompliance including the transfer and use of chemical weapons.\n",

      "Original article:  Published June 12 2016 At least 39 people were killed and dozens were injured in airstrikes launched by the Syrian regime and Russian warplanes in Syrias western province of Idlib on Sunday. A Syrian regime warplane struck a marketplace in the opposition-held province local civil defense official Leys al-Faris told Anadolu Agency. \"At least 36 people were killed and 50 others injured in the attack\" he said. Al-Faris described the attack as a \"massacre\" committed by the Bashar Assad regime during the fasting month of Ramadan which began in Syria last week. He said rescuers were struggling to extract people from under the rubble of destroyed buildings. Meanwhile three people were killed in a Russian airstrike on a residential area in the city of Maaret al-Numan in Idlib. \"Rescuers are looking for survivors following the attack\" al-Faris said. Since April 21 Syrian regime forces and Russian warplanes have intensified attacks on opposition-held areas in Syria killings scores of civilians. This comes as the opposition-held sector of Syrias divided city of Aleppo has been cut off from the outside world in recent days by an escalation of air and artillery strikes on the only road in putting hundreds of thousands of people under effective siege. A regime campaign to fully capture Aleppo would most likely bury what little hope remains of reviving a diplomatic effort to end the five-year-old civil war after talks and a ceasefire sponsored by the United States and Russia fell apart earlier this year. Aleppo Syrias largest city before the war when it had more than 2 million people has been divided for years into opposition and government sectors and capturing all of it has been one of Bashar Assads biggest goals. An estimated 350000 people are still thought to live in the opposition sector in harsh conditions made worse by the latest attempt to besiege them by cutting off the last remaining route out the Castello Road named for Aleppos old castle. \"The regime was not able to cut the road by land so it has decided to keep the planes in the sky continuously hitting everything that passes regardless of what it is\" said Zakaria Malahifji senior official in the Aleppo opposition group Fastaqim. \"Whoever wants to go on the Castello road is undertaking a suicide mission\" he said. \"Its been this way for 10 or 12 days. The situation was difficult before - it was targeted and people were crossing with difficulty - but now it is almost cut nobody dares to use it\" he said speaking at his groups office in the Turkish city of Gaziantep near the Syrian border. The international focus in Syria in recent weeks has partly turned towards the conflict with Islamic State fighters as both the government and its enemies have made gains at the expense of the ultra-hardline Islamist militants on several fronts. But the separate hope of foreign powers - that the wider civil war could also be resolved - has broken down with Aleppo potentially the biggest battlefield of all. Hundreds of people have been killed there since peace talks broke off. Assad vowed in a speech last week to recapture \"every inch\" of Syria. Aleppo he said would be a \"graveyard\" for the ambitions of his regional foe Turkish President Tayyip Erdoan who has backed opposition groups. A pro-Damascus source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the reference was a signal of his intentions \"Why this threat? Because there are preparations for something big in Aleppo.\" So far pro-regime ground forces aided by Iranian and Lebanese Shiite militias have been unable to complete the encirclement of Aleppo by capturing a narrow corridor of territory through which the Castello Road passes. The highway had long been under sniper fire but attacks from the air and artillery sharply increased less than two weeks ago with more planes flying and new rockets and guns moved into range. \"Castello is the road to death to Aleppo. I did not know whether I would make it to Aleppo city alive\" said Mohamad Adeeb an opposition activist who drove the road on Friday. \"I saw death with my own eyes with corpses lying on the way and dozens of trucks and civilian cars and bodies that none of the civil defence teams were able to recover because of the intensity of the shelling of the regime and Russian warplanes.\" Inside Aleppo the new pressure on the road has driven up prices of goods adding to the suffering of those still there. The Syrian Obervatory for Human Rights says more than 300 people have been killed in air strikes and government bombardment of opposition-held Aleppo since April. Opposition sources say the toll is much higher with dozens of people currently being killed each day in eastern Aleppo one of the bloodiest spells it has suffered in the conflict. Civil defence emergency workers operating in opposition-held areas say more than 450 people were killed there in the last month. \"It is a difficult and dangerous period we are going through. Aleppo is almost under siege\" Abu Yassine said. Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests with unexpected ferocity. Since then more than a quarter of a million people have been killed and more than 10 million displaced across the war-battered country according to the UN. The Syrian Center for Policy Research however put the death toll from the six-year conflict at more than 470000 people.\n",

BEIRUT August 21 (The Associated Press) Syrian regime forces fired intense artillery and rocket barrages Wednesday on the eastern suburbs of the capital Damascus in what two pro-opposition groups claimed was a \"poisonous gas\" attack that killed dozens of people. The claims came as a 20-member UN chemical weapons team was in Syria to investigate three sites where chemical weapons attacks had allegedly occurred in the past. The Syrian government promptly denied the reports of Wednesdays chemical weapons attack as baseless. \"They are an attempt by to divert the UN commission on chemical weapons from carrying out its mission\" the state-run SANA news agency said quoting an unnamed government official as is its standard practice. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the shelling was intense and hit the capitals eastern suburbs of Zamalka Arbeen and Ein Tarma. It quoted activists as saying that regime forces fired \"rockets with poisonous gas heads\" in the attack that killed \"tens of people.\" Rami Abdul-Rahman the Observatory chief said the activists in the area said \"poisonous gas\" was fired in rockets as well as from the air. He added that regime forces were on a wide offensive on the eastern and western rebel-held suburbs of Damascus. Another group the Local Coordination Committees said hundreds of people were killed or injured in the shelling. Such different figures from activists groups are common in the immediate aftermaths of attacks in Syria where the government restricts foreign and domestic reporting. Abdul-Rahman said more than 40 people have been confirmed dead and that the death toll could reach as many as 200 in the suburbs of Damascus. The Syrian government has long denied claims by the opposition on chemical weapons use saying rebels fighting to overthrow President Bashar Assads government have used such weapons. Following Wednesdays reports the Observatory called upon the UN team in Syria and all international organizations \"to visit the stricken areas and to guarantee that medical and relief supplies reach the people as soon as possible.\" It also called for an investigation into the attack. Mohammed Saeed an activist in the area told The Associated Press via Skype that hundreds of dead and injured people were rushed to six makeshift hospitals in the eastern suburbs of Damascus. \"This is a massacre by chemical weapons\" said Saeed. \"The visit by the UN team is a joke ... Bashar is using the weapons and telling the world that he does not care.\" The UN team led by Swedish expert Ake Sellstrom is meant to probe three sites the village of Khan al-Assal just west of the embattled northern city of Aleppo and two other locations which are being kept secret for security reasons. Wednesdays claim of the chemical attack if confirmed would be the most serious report since the March 19 claim of the attack in Khan al-Assal when at least 30 people were reported killed. Assads regime and the rebels have blamed each other for that attack. The unrest in Syria began in March 2011 and later escalated into a civil war. More than 100000 people have been killed in the conflict so far according to the United Nations.

      "TWICE EXTRACTED ARTICLE:  August 22 (The Associated Press) Russian forces fired intense artillery and rocket barrages Tuesday on the eastern suburbs of the capital Damascus in what two pro-opposition groups claimed was a \"poisonous gas\" attack that killed dozens of people. The claims came as a 20-member UN chemical weapons team was in Syria to investigate three sites where chemical weapons attacks had allegedly occurred in the past.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Syrian government promptly denied the reports of Tuesday's chemical weapons attack as baseless. \"They are an attempt by to divert the UN commission on chemical weapons from carrying out its mission\" the state-run SANA news agency said quoting an unnamed government official as is its standard practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the shelling was intense and hit the capitals eastern suburbs of Zamalka Arbeen and Ein Tarma. It quoted activists as saying that Russian forces fired \"rockets with poisonous gas heads\" in the attack that killed \"tens of people.\" Rami Abdul-Rahman the Observatory chief said the activists in the area said \"poisonous gas\" was fired in rockets as well as from the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "He added that Russian forces were on a wide offensive on the eastern and western rebel-held suburbs of Damascus. Another group the Local Coordination Committees said hundreds of people were killed or injured in the shelling. Such different figures from activists groups are common in the immediate aftermaths of attacks in Syria where the government restricts foreign and domestic reporting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abdul-Rahman said more than 40 people have been confirmed dead and that the death toll could reach as many as 200 in the suburbs of Damascus. The Syrian government has long denied claims by the opposition on chemical weapons use saying rebels fighting to overthrow President Bashar Assads government have used such weapons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following Tuesday's reports the Observatory called upon the UN team in Syria and all international organizations \"to visit the stricken areas and to guarantee that medical and relief supplies reach the people as soon as possible.\" It also called for an investigation into the attack. Mohammed Saeed an activist in the area told The Associated Press via Skype that hundreds of dead and injured people were rushed to six makeshift hospitals in the eastern suburbs of Damascus.\n",

      "Original article:  32 killed in Syrias Daraa Aleppo NGO Friday 15 Aug 2014 Print Tweet Views 458 Related Lebanon charges 43 Syrians with belonging to terrorist groups 2000 Syria refugees stranded in Lebanon mountains Nun Morocco busts jihadist Iraq Syria recruitment network At least 22 people were killed Friday when a car bomb exploded in front of a mosque in Daraa province of southern Syria the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Among the dead in the blast in the rebel-controlled town of Namar were a woman and a child the Britain-based monitoring group said. In northern Syria the Observatory reported 10 people killed when regime helicopters dropped explosive-packed \"barrel bombs\" on Aleppo city. The attacks targeted the Bab al-Nairab district of the Old City and the southern Salahin neighbourhood. North of Aleppo city the Observatory said jihadists from the Islamic State (IS) group extended their advances seizing Baghaydin village near the border with Turkey. On Wednesday IS fighters captured eight villages in the area between Aleppo and the border from rival rebel groups. Those advances came after clashes that killed at least 40 fighters from rebel groups as well as 12 IS fighters according to the Observatory. The successes open the way for IS to move towards two strategic prizes - Aazaz and Marea. Marea is a stronghold of the Islamic Front a coalition of Islamist groups that is among those fighting against IS. Aazaz sits next to a border crossing with Turkey which would be a valuable asset as IS seeks to expand its self-declared \"caliphate\" in the territory it holds in Syria and neighbouring Iraq. IS emerged from Al-Qaedas one-time branch in Iraq and initially fought alongside Syrias opposition including more moderate rebels and Al-Nusra fighters. But its abuses and harsh brand of religion prompted a backlash from rebel groups that pushed it out of many opposition-held areas earlier this year. Since then it has staged a comeback bolstered by weaponry obtained in advances across the border in Iraq. One analyst warned Friday that the fate of Syrias \"Western-backed opposition in northern Syria hangs quite literally on a knife-edge\" as IS advances in northern Aleppo and regime forces advance in Aleppo city. In an opinion piece published on CNNs website Charles Lister of the Brookings Doha Centre said Syrias rebels were facing an \"existential threat\". Lister said IS was likely to move into Aazaz cutting rebel supply lines to Syria and into Marea from which it could launch attacks on rebel-held parts of Aleppo city. Aleppo has been divided between rebel control in the east and regime control in the west since shortly after fighting began there in mid-2012. In the face of regime advances around the eastern outskirts of the city coupled with IS advances farther north the remaining rebels inside Aleppo are increasingly beleaguered. Fighting in the province has left civilians there \"living in appalling conditions\" the International Committee of the Red Cross said on Friday. The ICRC said it was working with Syrias Red Crescent to deliver medical aid to all parts of the province in both rebel- and regime-held territory. \"Stepping up aid distributions in the governorate has been the ICRCs priority ever since we established a permanent presence in the city over a year ago\" it said. More than 170000 people have been killed in Syria since the beginning of its conflict in March 2011 according to the Observatory.\n",

      "Original article:  Friday 10 July 2015 19:14 ISIS Continues to Displace Locals in Rural Deir Ezzor. The Syrian Network for Human Rights said in a report released today that ISIS had forced at least 33000 residents out of their homes in the town of Abu Hamam in rural Deir Ezzor since 10 August 2014. According to report ISIS has executed around 367 people in the town while 240 more have gone missing. The Syrian Coalition has previously condemned the heinous crime committed by ISIS in eastern rural Deir Ezzor where residents discovered a mass grave containing 230 corpses of tribesmen who were summarily executed by ISIS in late 2014. The area was the scene of fierce battles between the Shaitat tribesmen and ISIS militants who eventually took control of the area and rounded up hundreds of tribesmen and executed them on charges of apostasy. The Syrian Coalition stresses that modern dictatorships have left nothing but a legacy of mass graves death and destruction. Four years have passed since Assad embarked on his brutal campaign on the Syrian people and now ISIS to pursue the same campaign and one can hardly find any difference between the two in terms of the scale of their criminality and barbarity. Despite the unprecedented sacrifices Syrians are determined to move forward in their revolution with the aim of building a state justice law freedom and dignity for all its citizens.

The Syrian Coalition has previously condemned the heinous crime committed by ISIS in eastern rural Aleppo where residents discovered a mass grave containing 230 corpses of tribesmen who were summarily executed by ISIS in late 2014. The area was the scene of fierce battles between the Shaitat tribesmen and ISIS militants who eventually took control of the area and rounded up hundreds of tribesmen and executed them on charges of apostasy. The Syrian Coalition stresses that modern dictatorships have left nothing but a legacy of mass graves death and destruction. Four years have passed since Assad embarked on his brutal campaign on the Syrian people and now ISIS to pursue the same campaign and one can hardly find any difference between the two in terms of the scale of their criminality and barbarity. Despite the unprecedented sacrifices Syrians are determined to move forward in their revolution with the aim of building a state justice law freedom and dignity for all its citizens.\n",

      "Original article:  Date of publication 8 April 2017 An airstrike by Russian warplanes on Saturday killed 18 people including five children and two women in the rebel stronghold of Urom al-Joz in Syrias Idlib province. Tags Syria Idlib airstrike Russian human rights Homs bombing Islamic State At least 18 civilians including five children and two women were killed in an airstrike on Syrias northwestern province of Idlib on Saturday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. An earlier death toll from the strike on the rebel stronghold of Urum al-Joz reported 15 people were killed but three more died after sustaining serious injuries. The names of all 18 killed were listed by Ariha Today activist group which said the death toll is likely to rise as many of the wounded remain in critical conditions. The Britain-based Observatory said the strike was likely to have been carried out by Russian war jets which operate in support of the Syrian regime. The Observatory which relies on a network of sources inside Syria for its information says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used. Idlib province is controlled by a rebel alliance that includes former al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and is regularly targeted by both the Syrian regime and its Russian ally. Earlier this week a suspected chemical attack hit the town of Khan Sheikhun in Idlib killing at least 87 civilians including 31 children. Much of the international community accused Bashar al-Assads regime of responsibility for that attack though Damascus involved responsibility. The Khan Sheikhun strike prompted Washington to take its first direct military action against Assads regime with missile strikes against a central air base on Friday morning. In return Moscow announced it would ramp up air defences in Syria in an attempt to show a tough line on the US actions. Bus bombing in Homs province Also on Saturday Syrian state TV reported a bomb exploded aboard a bus carrying workers near the central city of Homs killing a woman and wounding 25. It gave no further details about the explosion but the governor of Homs province Talal Barrazi told AP the bomb was placed inside a bus that transports workers at a private factory. The Observatory confirmed a woman was killed in the blast saying it also wounded more than 20 people. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack but Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and the Islamic State group have carried out similar attacks in the past. More than 320000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government demonstrations. Read Also\n",

Earlier this week a suspected chemical attack hit the town of Khan Sheikhun in Idlib killing at least 87 civilians including 31 children. Much of the international community accused Bashar al-Assad's regime of responsibility for that attack though Damascus involved responsibility. The Khan Sheikhun strike prompted Washington to take its first direct military action against Assad's regime with missile strikes against a central air base on Friday morning. In return Moscow announced it would ramp up air defences in Syria in an attempt to show a tough line on the US actions. Bus bombing in Homs province Also on Saturday Syrian state TV reported a bomb exploded aboard a bus carrying workers near the central city of Homs killing a woman and wounding 25. It gave no further details about the explosion but the governor of Homs province Talal Barrazi told AP the bomb was placed inside a bus that transports workers at a private factory. The Observatory confirmed a woman was killed in the blast saying it also wounded more than 20 people. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack but Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and the Islamic State group have carried out similar attacks in the past. More than 320,000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government demonstrations. Read Also\n",

Abdah also said that this complete inaction towards Assads atrocities represents a bias in favor of a serial killer and a war criminal. At least 13 civilians mostly women and children were killed and over 30 others were wounded on Saturday when regime forces bombed a popular market in the District of Douma in Rural Damascus with heavy artillery.

      "Original article:  December 19 2016 Kurd-led forces press Islamic State near Syrias Raqqa. Several villages held by Islamic State have been captured by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) a coalition of militias backed by the United States that includes a strong Kurdish contingent an organisation that monitors the war said on Monday. Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fighters walk in Tal Samin village north of Raqqa city Syria November 19 2016. REUTERS/Rodi Said The advance is part of a military campaign backed by an international coalition led by the United States to drive Islamic State from its Syrian capital of Raqqa. It follows SDF gains against the jihadist group across the north of the country. The strongest group in the SDF is the Peoples Protection Units or YPG a Kurdish militia but Washington has said that any operation to retake Raqqa should be predominantly Arab the ethnicity of most of the citys residents. The latest advances in the countryside about 50 km (30 miles) west and northwest of Raqqa follow an earlier phase of SDF gains on another front about 30 km north of the city. Three SDF soldiers were killed fighting Islamic State after the capture of five villages the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based war monitor said on Monday. Islamic State had been on the back foot in both Syria and Iraq where it is under attack in Mosul its biggest and most important possession and after a string of U.S. air strikes that have killed many of its leaders this year. However earlier this month it launched a surprise attack 160 km southwest of Raqqa to retake the ancient desert city of Palmyra which it had lost in March to Syrian army forces backed by Russian air power after a nine-month occupation. That attack demonstrated the risks still posed by the group across Syria even after its territorial losses there since mid-2015 including holdings along the Turkish border which were once its main route for supplies and recruits. Complicating the efforts against Islamic State is a second campaign being waged against it in northwest Syria by Turkey and Syrian rebel groups allied to Ankara. This has taken a large area from the jihadist group but is also aimed at stopping Kurdish expansion. The Turkish-backed Syrian rebels are now attempting to capture the city of al-Bab from Islamic State a move that will end Kurdish hopes of uniting their two separated areas of self rule in northern Syria. Early on Monday the Turkish military said one of its soldiers had been killed in a car bomb in al-Bab on Sunday and that 11 militants were also killed in clashes that day.

Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fighters walk in Tal Samin village north of Raqqa city Syria November 19 2016. REUTERS/Rodi Said The advance is part of a military campaign backed by an international coalition led by the United States to drive Islamic State from its Syrian capital of Raqqa. It follows SDF gains against the jihadist group across the north of the country. The strongest group in the SDF is the Peoples Protection Units or YPG a Kurdish militia but Washington has said that any operation to retake Raqqa should be predominantly Arab the ethnicity of most of the city's residents. The latest advances in the countryside about 50 km (30 miles) west and northwest of Raqqa follow an earlier phase of SDF gains on another front about 30 km north of the city. Eleven militants were killed fighting Islamic State after the capture of five villages due to a shelling attack by Russian forces, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based war monitor on Monday.

Regime aircraft were believed responsible for the attacks on the area believed to be held by Islamic State group fighters. The Syrian Observatory of Human Rights (SOHR) referenced seven local sources saying the majority of casualties occurred when regime forces attacked a school being used as a shelter for families displaced by the fighting.

A man inspects the site of a suicide and car bomb attack near Sayeda Zeinab shrine in Damascus Syria June 11 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) At least 20 people including 13 civilians were killed and over 30 people were wounded in suicide and car bomb attacks targeting Sayeda Zeinab shrine in the suburbs of Damascus said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) an independent group which documents human rights in the country. SANA news agency said at least two suicide bombers one in a car blew themselves near the entrance of Sayeda Zeinab shrine a site of great significance especially to Shia Muslims. The official agency placed the death toll at 12. Terrorist organisation DAESH claimed responsibility via its news arm Amaq. A repeat target The last attack on Sayeda Zeinab shrine on April 25 killed at least seven and wounded dozens. A string of bombings near the shrine in February left 134 people dead most of them civilians according to the Observatory. And in January another attack claimed by the outlawed group killed 70 people. People inspect a damaged site after a suicide and car bomb attack in south Damascus Shiite suburb of Sayeda Zeinab Syria June 11 2016. (Reuters) Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah cited the threat to Sayeda Zeinab as a principal reason for its intervention in Syrias civil war on the side of Bashar al Assad. The shrine is said to contain the grave of Zeinab a venerated granddaughter of the Prophet Muhammed and is renowned for its glistening golden onion-shaped dome. Daraya bombed after receiving food aid after four years The Syrian regime has been accused of dropping barrel bombs on the rebel-held town of Daraya on Friday hours after it received its first shipment of food aid since 2012. United Nation announced on Thursday it had been granted permission by Syria to send convoys with humanitarian aid to all of the countrys 19 besieged areas including Daraya by the end of June. Daraya receives first food aid in four years Oliver Whitfield-Miocic reports - YouTube The convoy started delivering rice lentils sugar oil and wheat flour to civilians late Thursday. Trucks have supplied a months supply for 2400 people. An estimated 8000 people live in the town which is just a 15-minutes drive southwest of Damascus. Just delivered food nutrition health medical WASH & education supplies in Daraya Syria with UN SYRedCrescent pic.twitter.comuLlH0tMPVR OCHA Syria (OCHASyria) June 10 2016 Early Friday the town came under heavy bombardment with the SOHR saying Syrian helicopters had dropped at least 20 barrel bombs. There is no official information about casualties after air strikes by the regime. Local council member Shadi Matar said aid had not yet been distributed \"because of the intensity of the raids.\" The strikes came as US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (mainly Arab and Kurdish forces) said they had encircled a stronghold of DAESH militants in Manbij northern Syria cutting off a major supply route. On June 1 Daraya received its first shipment of medical aid. \"The last time people were filling the streets waiting for the aid to come in\" activist Shadi Matar told AFP from inside Daraya. On May 12 a five-truck aid convoy waiting on Darayas outskirts was denied permission to enter in a dramatic 11th-hour rejection. A man holds a child as he stands near a convoy carrying food supplies for Syrian rebel-held town of Daraya in this handout picture provided by the World Food Programme on June 10 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) An aid convoy carrying food entered the besieged area of al Houla in Homs province on Saturday the International Committee of the Red Cross said; the second such delivery in months. Condemning air strikes United States State Department spokesperson Mark Toner slammed the air strikes on Daraya. \"Such attacks are unacceptable in any circumstance but in this case they also hampered the delivery and distribution of badly needed assistance\". French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault also accused Damascus of \"extraordinary duplicity\" over the bombings. Ayrault said he was \"outraged beyond words\" declaring the end of the Russian-US brokered \"cessation of hostilities\" deal. According to deal the warring sides would stop fighting each other. It does not include DAESH and Al Qaeda-affiliated al Nusra Front. Around 600000 people are living in besieged areas in Syria most surrounded by the regime and another four million in hard-to-reach areas said the UN.

In the chaos of the first blasts' aftermath and as a crowd gathered, the second bomber detonated his explosives, Barazi said. The Al-Zahraa district of Aleppo has been targeted in multiple bomb attacks in the past including in late December when 19 people were killed in several simultaneous blasts.\n",

The death toll from twin the terrorist ugly explosions in the Syrian province of Homs rose to 32 and more than 115 wounded persons most of them children and several sustaining critical injuries. Two terrorist bombings hit an area near a school compound in Ikrima neighborhood in Homs city on Wednesday. A source in the central province said that terrorists detonated up a car bomb in front of the New Ikrima School and only a few minutes later a suicide bomber blew himself up in front of Ikrima al-Makhzoumi School. The attacks took place at the time when students were leaving school to inflict maximum casualties. The source pointed out that the car bomb was made up of three gas cylinders each packed with 7 kg of C4 explosives and concealed in a Mazda. Prime Minister Dr. Wael al-Halqi condemned the twin terrorist blasts that rocked Homs city on Wednesday.

Al-Halqi said these terrorist acts will make us even stronger and more determined to restore security and stability all over Syria. In the same context Regional leadership of al-Baath Arab Socialist Part strongly condemned the twin terrorist explosions that targeted the students. In a statement the Partys leadership said that the terrorist twin explosions reveal again the brutality of terrorists and their hatred against the Syrian citizens who achieved a lot of victories over terrorism.

      "Original article:  Saturday 20 August 2016 Syrian Coalition Urges Intl Community to Stop Crimes by Regime and Russia against Syrian Civilians. The Syrian Coalition called on the European Union the United States and friends of the Syrian people to take immediate action in order to stop crimes carried out by the Assad regime and Russia against civilians in Syria. The Assad regime backed by Russia and allied forces continues with the campaign of terror against the Syrian people. The Coalition warned that mass killings destruction and displacement by the Assad regime and its allies undermine all chances of reaching a political settlement needed to end the suffering of the Syrian people. Activists in northern rural Homs said that the Assad regime and Russian forces have recently intensified aerial attacks on rebel-held areas. At least 13 civilians were killed and 30 others wounded in airstrikes by regime and Russian fighter jets on the town of Alghantou on Friday. Airstrikes also targeted the nearby towns of Rastan Talbeesah Ter Maaleh and Zafarana. Meanwhile Albir hospital and civilian homes in the district of Alwaer in Homs were subject to intense regime shelling on Friday with reports of civilian casualties. Activists said that the Assad regime has recently resorted to spreading rumors and misinformation to instill fear among residents of the district; a tactic Russia used in Ukraine. The Coalition stressed that the barbaric crimes death and destruction the Assad regime and its allies have been wreaking in Syria will not succeed in breaking the will of the Syrian people. The coalition warned of dire consequences as a result of the international communitys continued silence over these crimes. (Source: Syrian Coalition) Twitter\n",

The bullet-riddled bodies of the three were found on Friday two days after suspected Islamist militants kidnapped them in the oil-rich eastern province of Deir Ezzor said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. ISIL which grew from the ranks of Al-Qaeda before splitting with the global terror network is active in both Syria and neighbouring Iraq and seeks to set up an Islamic state that straddles both countries. But the radical group has faced a major backlash from other rebels fighting to topple the Syrian regime and from Al-Qaedas affiliate in Syria Al-Nusra Front amid accusations of atrocities in Syrias three-year war. The FSA this month called for help from \"friendly and brotherly Arab nations\" to fight ISIL in Deir Ezzor. Rebels in Syria including Al-Nusra Front militants have been battling ISIL since the start of the year in fighting that has reportedly killed more than 6000 people. The clashes have mostly raged in the north and east of the country and on Friday ISIL seized control of the areas of Hafez and Muhassen in Deir Ezzor. The FSA officers executed by the jihadists had been kidnapped in Hafez the Britain-based Observatory said. ISIL has been battling Iraqi government forces since June 9 when in launched a lightening offensive in the north of the country.\n",

Elsewhere a purported deal has been reached that will see rebels evacuated to Idlib from the Damascus suburb of Qudsaya. More than a dozen airstrikes had been carried out overnight in rebel-held districts of east Aleppo amid ongoing bombardment of the area by Syrian regime and Russian warplanes. The Syrian Civil Defence or White Helmets reported on Thursday that 13 people had been killed and 25 injured in airstrikes with defence teams still looking under rubble for survivors. Relentless bombardment According to the Halab Today TV station cluster munitions were deployed over east Aleppo while the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said that clashes had taken place between pro-regime forces and rebels in Aleppos northern suburbs. Over 350 civilians have been killed in east Aleppo since a US-Russian brokered ceasefire collapsed on September 19 according to the UK-based monitor. An international meeting headed by the US and Russia is set to take place in Lausanne this Saturday aimed at curbing deadly violence in Syria with a particular focus on Aleppo where life in rebel-held districts of the city has been described as a \"merciless abyss of humanitarian catastrophe\". Elsewhere in Syria the Observatory reported government bombardment on rebel positions in Daraa Hama Idlib and Homs provinces. Another evacuation deal in Damascus Meanwhile in Damascus reports emerged that a deal had been reached between the Syrian regime and rebel fighters in the suburb of Qudsaya that will see some 150 rebels and their families leave the area and be transferred to the north-western province of Idlib. Rebels are set to hand over light weapons to regime authorities on Thursday before they are transported away from the area on Friday in a manner similar to deals that have taken place previously this year in other suburbs of Damascus such as Daraya and Moadamiyeh and the al-Waer neighbourhood of Homs.

      "TWICE EXTRACTED ARTICLE:  Civilians in rebel-held east Hasaka continue to face relentless bombardment. Elsewhere a purported deal has been reached that will see rebels evacuated to Idlib from the Damascus suburb of Qudsaya. More than a dozen airstrikes had been carried out overnight in rebel-held districts of east Hasaka amid ongoing bombardment of the area by USA army warplanes. The Syrian Civil Defence or White Helmets reported on Thursday that 13 people had been killed and 25 injured in airstrikes with defence teams still looking under rubble for survivors. Relentless bombardment According to the Halab Today TV station cluster munitions were deployed over east Hasaka while the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said that clashes had taken place between pro-regime forces and rebels in Hasakas northern suburbs. Over 350 civilians have been killed in east Hasaka since a US-Russian brokered ceasefire collapsed on September 19 according to the UK-based monitor. An international meeting headed by the US and Russia is set to take place in Lausanne this Saturday aimed at curbing deadly violence in Syria with a particular focus on Hasaka where life in rebel-held districts of the city has been described as a \"merciless abyss of humanitarian catastrophe\".

      "Original article:  Date of publication 7 July 2016 Video More than 33 people were killed in Syrian regime and Russian bombing on Wednesday despite Damascus promises of a truce to mark the Muslim Eid holidays. Syrian regime Manbij human rights truce Eid Syrian opposition territories were bombed on Wednesday hours after the Syrian regime announced a nationwide ceasefire for three days. Rebel-held areas in Aleppo and Idlib provinces were bombed despite Damascus promise of a 72-hours Eid al-Fitr truce. Three children were killed in five separate air raids on Jisr al-Shigour in Idlib province while a car bomb exploded outside a mosque in the city according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Other air raids took place in Aleppo while clashes between rebels and regime fighters continued across the day. A total of 33 people died according to the Local Coordination Committees with Russian and regime war planes both suspected. Regime advances cut the only road leading to rebel-held parts of Aleppo in the firing range cutting it off on Thursday. \"Currently nobody can get in or out of Aleppo\" a member of the Aleppo-based rebel group Fastaqim told Reuters. \"[The road] was not risk-free but now there is not a matter of danger now the road is cut\" Zakaria Malahjifi said. Rebel forces are battling to push back regime advances. [Click to enlarge] \"All the factions sent reinforcements and are trying to take back the positions taken by the government but the situation is very bad there was heavy government air cover in the night\" another rebel official told Reuters. It is estimated that between 250000 and 300000 people live in areas held by the opposition in Aleppo according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. In Ghouta a rebel-held area in the Damascus suburbs regime artillery hit Douma city while clashes continued between rebel and regime fighters in Daraa Latakia and Homs. Meanwhile US-led coalition warplanes killed 56 civilians including 19 children in Manbij in Aleppo province according to the Observatory. Assault on Manbij Kurdish-led forces are continuing their assault on the Islamic State group stronghold in northern Syria and are slowly advancing in the southern districts of Manbij and seized a number of silos on Wednesday. Coalition aircraft which are supporting the Kurdish-Arab forces on the ground have conducted 325 air raids around Manbij since 21 May including 29 strikes in the past four days. This has helped anti-IS fighters to gain 1000 kilometres of territory and a foothold in Manbij which is an important supply route for the jihadi force. \"The SDF [Syrian Democratic Forces] has repeatedly defeated [IS] attempts to punch a hole through the cordon\" said Operation Inherent Resolve spokesperson Colonel Christopher Garver on Wednesday. He said this pressure is forcing IS to bring in new recruits to defend the city from the Kurdish-Arab force. \"Weve seen [IS] fighters leaving these previously defended towns to attempt to reinforce Manbij\" Garver said. \"As the pressure increases against [IS] in Manbij they are demonstrating more desperation to keep [IS] strategic crossroads open for access outside Syria.\" Read Also\n",

      "Original article:  Sun Aug 17 2014 ISIL kills 700 people from Syrian tribe. The so-called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) militant group has executed 700 members of a tribe it has been battling in eastern Syria during the past two weeks the majority of them civilians a human rights monitoring group says. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which has tracked violence on all sides of the three-year-old conflict said on Saturday that reliable sources reported beheadings were used to execute many of the al-Sheitaat tribe which is from Deir al-Zour province. The conflict between ISIL and the al-Sheitaat tribe who number about 70000 flared after the militants took over two oil fields in July. Those who were executed are all al-Sheitaat Observatory director Rami Abdel-Rahman said by telephone from Britain. Some were arrested judged and killed. Straddling parts of Iraq and Syria ISIL has swept across northern Iraq in recent weeks pushing back Kurdish regional forces and driving tens of thousands of Muslims Christians and members of the Yazidi religious minority from their homes. The insurgents are also tightening their grip in parts of Syria of which they now control roughly a third mostly rural areas in the north and east. An activist in Deir al-Zour who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters that 300 men were executed in one day in the town of Ghraneij one of the three main towns of the al-Sheitaat tribal heartland when ISIL stormed the town earlier this week. Another opposition activist from Deir al-Zour said residents of al-Sheitaat towns had been given three days to leave. Civilians fleeing al-Sheitaat towns had either taken sanctuary in other villages or travelled to Iraq he said. More than 170000 people have been reportedly killed in Syrias conflict which pits overwhelmingly Takfiri militants against the Syrian government since March 2011. NTJHH\n",

      "Original article:  30-11-2014 50 ISIL Terrorists Killed in Kobani in 24 Hours. At least 50 ISIL terrorists have been killed in the past 24 hours in clashes suicide bombings and US-led air strikes in Syrias Kobani a monitor said Sunday. At least 50 ISIL terrorists have been killed in the past 24 hours in clashes suicide bombings and US-led air strikes in Syrias Kobani a monitor said Sunday. The opposing UK-based Syrian Observatory said the number of deaths was one of the highest daily tolls for the terrorist group since it launched an assault on the strategic town on the Turkish border in September. The monitoring group said at least five of those killed were suicide bomb attackers two of them involved in attacks on the border crossing that separates Kobani from Turkey. Another 11 were killed in clashes that ensued between Kobanis Kurdish defenders and the jihadists at the border after the bombings but there was no breakdown for the remaining toll. The group also said 11 Kurdish fighters were killed in the same period in Kobani along with one Syrian rebel fighter backing the Kurdish forces. ISIL began advancing on Kobani on September 16 hoping to quickly seize the small border town and secure its grip on a large stretch of the Syrian-Turkish border. At one point it looked set to overrun the town but Kurdish Syrian fighters backed by US-led coalition air strikes and an influx of Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga forces have held back the group. For now the town remains roughly evenly divided between ISIL and Kurdish control.\n",

      "Original article:  August 21 2013 Syria gas kills hundreds Security Council meets. Dominic Evans Khaled Yacoub Oweis. Syrias opposition accused government forces of gassing hundreds of people on Wednesday by firing rockets that released deadly fumes over rebel-held Damascus suburbs killing men women and children as they slept. With the death toll estimated between 500 and 1300 what would be the worlds most lethal chemical weapons attack since the 1980s prompted an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council in New York. The council did not explicitly demand a U.N. investigation of the incident although it said clarity was needed and welcomed U.N. chief Ban Ki-moons calls for a prompt investigation by the U.N. inspection team in Syria led by Ake Sellstrom. An earlier Western-drafted statement submitted to the council seen by Reuters was not approved. The final version of the statement was watered down to accommodate objections from Russia and China diplomats said. Moscow and Beijing have vetoed previous Western efforts to impose U.N. penalties on Assad. Syrian Information Minister Omran Zoabi said the allegations were illogical and fabricated. President Bashar al-Assads officials have said they would never use poison gas against Syrians. The United States and European allies believe Assads forces have used small amounts of sarin before hence the current U.N. visit. Immediate international action is likely to be limited with the divisions among major powers that have crippled efforts to quell 2 1/2 years of civil war still much in evidence. Russia backed up Syrian government denials by saying it looked like a rebel provocation to discredit Assad. Britain voiced the opposite view: I hope this will wake up some who have supported the Assad regime to realize its murderous and barbaric nature Foreign Secretary William Hague said on a visit to Paris. France Britain the United States and others called for an immediate on-site investigation by U.N. chemical weapons inspectors who arrived in the Syrian capital only this week. Moscow urging an objective inquiry said the very presence of that team suggested government forces were not to blame. U.S. President Barack Obama has made the use of chemical weapons by Assads forces a red line that in June triggered more U.S. aid to the rebels. But previous smaller and disputed cases of their deployment have not brought the all-out military intervention rebel leaders have sought to break a stalemate. U.S. Senator John McCain a Republican critic of Obamas Syria policy said on Twitter that failure to penalize previous gas attacks had emboldened Assad: No consequence for Assad using chemical weapons & crossing red line he said. We shouldnt be surprised hes using them again. Images including some by freelance photographers supplied to Reuters showed scores of bodies - some of them small children - laid on the floor of a clinic with no visible signs of injury. Some showed people with foam around their mouths. A boy who survived from what activists say is a gas attack cries as he takes shelter inside a mosque in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus August 21 2013. REUTERS/Mohamed Abdullah The United States and others said it had no independent confirmation that chemical weapons had been used. The U.N. chief Ban said the head of the inspection team in Damascus was already discussing the latest claims with the government. SLEEPING DEAD Opposition activists cited death tolls ranging from about 500 to - by one account - some 1300 after shells and rockets fell around 3 a.m. (0000 GMT) on Wednesday. In 1988 3000 to 5000 Iraqi Kurds were gassed by Saddam Husseins forces at Halabja. One man who said he had retrieved victims in the suburb of Erbin told Reuters: We would go into a house and everything was in its place. Every person was in their place. They were lying where they had been. They looked like they were asleep. Slideshow (21 Images) Doctors interviewed described symptoms they believe point to sarin gas one of the agents Western powers accuse Damascus of having in an undeclared chemical weapons stockpile. An opposition monitoring group citing figures compiled from clinics in the Damascus suburbs put the death toll at 494 with 90 percent killed by gas the rest by bombs and conventional arms. The rebel Syrian National Coalition said 650 people died. Activists said rockets with chemical agents hit the Damascus suburbs of Ain Tarma Zamalka and Jobar during a fierce pre-dawn bombardment by government forces. The Damascus Media Office said 150 bodies were counted in Hammouriya 100 in Kfar Batna 67 in Saqba 61 in Douma 76 in Mouadamiya and 40 in Erbin. A nurse at Douma Emergency Collection facility Bayan Baker said: Many of the casualties are women and children. They arrived with their pupils constricted cold limbs and foam in their mouths. The doctors say these are typical symptoms of nerve gas victims. Extensive amateur video and photographs appeared on the Internet showing victims choking some foaming at the mouth. A video purportedly shot in the Kafr Batna neighborhood showed a room filled with more than 90 bodies many of them children and a few women and elderly men. Most of the bodies appeared ashen or pale but with no visible injuries. Other footage showed doctors treating people in makeshift clinics. One video showed the bodies of a dozen people lying on the floor of a clinic. A voice-over said they were members of a single family. In a corridor outside lay another five bodies. Syria is one of just a handful of countries that are not parties to the international treaty that bans chemical weapons and Western nations believe it has caches of undeclared mustard gas sarin and VX nerve agents.

A regime helicopter struck twice a mourning location in the opposition-held Bab al-Nairab district in Aleppo Ibrahim Abu Leith told Anadolu Agency. \"Twenty people were killed and 30 others injured in the attack\" he said. According to Abu Leith women and children were among the fatalities. He said the second attack took place when the helicopter dropped another barrel bomb on people who rushed to the scene to help the victims of the first attack. The injured were rushed to field hospitals amid fears that death toll may rise as a number of civilians remain trapped under the debris of their destroyed homes. In recent weeks regime helicopters - along with Russian and Syrian warplanes - have struck a number of marketplaces hospitals and civil defense centers in opposition-held parts of war-battered Aleppo city. Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the Bashar al-Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests - which erupted as part of the \"Arab Spring\" uprisings - with unexpected ferocity. Since then more than a quarter of a million people have been killed and more than 10 million displaced across the war-battered country according to the UN. The Syrian Center for Policy Research however put the death toll from the six-year conflict at more than 470000 people.\n",

      "Original article:  Date of publication 19 August 2016 The uneasy peace in Syrias Hassakeh city was broken two days ago as clashes between regime and Kurdish forces escalated leading to Damascus to bomb separatist positions. Tags Qamishli Rojava Hassakeh Kurdish Syrian-Kurdish YPG Peoples Protection Units Turkey Syrian regime Syrian regime warplanes bombed Kurdish positions in the north-eastern city of Hassakeh on Friday as fighting between the two sides continued for a second day. The regime launched eight air raids - on the citys Kurdish-run south-western neighbourhoods - on Friday after an uneasy truce between regime and Kurdish militias broke down earlier this week leading to the latest bout of fighting. Images showed footage the city - reportedly Hassakeh - burning last night following one air raid. Control for Hassakeh city - the capital of the north-eastern province by the same name - is mostly in the hands of Kurdish forces while the rest is held by regime loyalists. Clashes between the two sides have rocked the city leaving 23 civilians - including nine children - dead according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Bombing and fighting has forced thousands of Hassakeh locals to flee in one of the most intense confrontations between the two sides in months. Thursdays air raids on Hassakeh were the first time the regime had bombarded Kurdish positions from the air. Damascus forces and Kurdish fighters have enjoyed a truce while the Islamic State group threatens the province and other Kurdish areas jointly controlled by the two sides. In Hassakeh and Qamishli tensions have led to armed clashes. Kurdish units have proclaimed independence of an autonomous region around the Turkish border and deeper into Syria and demanded that the pro-regime militias disband in Hassakeh. A regime source in Hassakeh told AFP that the bombing was \"a message to the Kurds that they should stop this sort of demand that constitutes an affront to national sovereignty\". Kurdish militias are key US allies in the fight against IS providing them with weapons and advisers on the battlefield. The US has also reportedly opened up an air base in Kurdish-controlled Syrian territory while Russia - which is helping prop up the regime - is also close to the Kurdish units.

The attacks were carried out in a blatant violation of UN Security Council resolutions 2118 and 2235 banning the use of chemical weapons and toxic substances. In a press release issued earlier on Tuesday the Syrian Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to shoulder its responsibilities towards stopping such attacks. It stressed that urgent measures must be taken under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations to protect the Syrian people.

      "Original article:  Syria air strikes kill dozens in rebel town Monitor AFP Wednesday 17 Sep 2014 Syrian air strikes on a besieged rebel town in the heart of the country have killed nearly 50 people over the past two days a monitoring group said on Wednesday. \"On Tuesday 25 people including seven women and a child were killed in air strikes on Talbisseh in Homs province\" the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said adding that a rebel commander was also among the dead. On Monday air strikes killed 23 people in the town which has been under siege by the army ever since rebels seized it two year ago. Activists appealed for help on Facebook. \"The towns hospital has received a large number of wounded patients. The hospital has no more medicines or bandages\" said one activist from Talbisseh. A security source in Damascus confirmed the air strikes. \"There are a large number of armed terrorist groups. On Tuesday Talbissehs most important terrorist and his brother were killed\" the source said using the regimes standard term for the rebels. He identified the dead commander as Abu Hatem al-Dahik head of the rebel Al-Iman Brigade. \"We will continue to target the terrorists in all their hideouts\" the source told AFP on condition of anonymity. The Observatory said that rebels in Talbisseh had shelled regime positions around the nearby rebel-held town of Umm Sharshuh as fighting raged around it. The towns are among a number that the rebels still hold in Homs province after their withdrawal from Homs city earlier year. The Observatory meanwhile updated to 18 its toll for the number of rebels killed in an abortive attempt to infiltrate the heart of Damascus on Monday. Two pro-regime militiamen were also killed. One person was killed in central Damascus on Wednesday by rebel fire from its outskirts the state SANA news agency reported. Some 191000 people have been killed since an uprising against President Bashar al-Assads rule erupted in March 2011.\n",

The missiles fired from a Syrian warplane also wounded 25 others Ibrahim Abu Leys told Anadolu Agency. Syria has been locked in a vicious civil war since early 2011 when the Bashar al-Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests - which erupted as part of the \"Arab Spring\" uprisings - with unexpected ferocity and disproportionate force. Since then more than a quarter of a million people have been killed - and more than 10 million displaced - throughout the war-battered country according to the UN. The Syrian Center for Policy Research an NGO however has put the death toll from the five-year conflict at as high as 470000.\n",

Activists said that at least 19 civilians including women and children were killed and dozens more wounded in airstrikes believed to be carried out by the Russian air force on the village of Almehemdiya in western rural Deir Ezzor. The Syrian Coalition strongly condemned the attack on Almehemdiya and the targeting of civilians across Syria especially the escalating Russian aggression on Syria after rebels managed to break the siege on Aleppo. The Coalition rejected any and all excuses used to justify the bombings in Syria stressing that targeting civilians including women and children cannot not be justified by fighting terror. Whether it was with a knife or an aircraft any attack on civilians is terrorism pure and simple the Coalition added. Meanwhile over 10 civilians were also killed and 18 more wounded in Russian airstrikes and barrel bomb attacks on the neighborhoods of Karam Alnozha and Tal Alzarazir in Aleppo on Tuesday. Activists in Daraya west of Damascus said that the rebel-held district was pounded with a barrage of barrel bombs as well as artillery and rocket shells while violent clashes between FSA fighters and regime forces on the outskirts of the district were reported.

      "Original article:  Last updated at Jul 262016 BEIRUT Syrian government forces on Tuesday seized a rebel-held neighbourhood in the northwest edge of Aleppo tightening their siege of opposition-controlled parts of the city a monitor said. The government also carried out renewed barrel bomb attacks on opposition-held districts a day after bombardments killed at least 24 people the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based monitor said regime troops had full control of the Leramun district after heavy clashes. It also reported intense fighting for neighbouring rebel-held district of Bani Zeid. The two areas have been used by rebels to launch rockets into government-held districts in the citys west. Aleppo has been roughly divided between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012. In recent weeks regime advances have severed the only remaining route into the rebel-held eastern neighbourhoods effectively placing them under siege. Opposition forces have responded by firing missiles into government districts killing scores of civilians. \"The importance of capturing Leramun and Bani Zeid is to stop the missile fire and also to further tighten the siege\" said observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman. He said government forces had now surrounded Bani Zeid reporting heavy air strikes in the area and clashes. The monitor had no immediate toll in the fighting. Government forces effectively severed the oppositions main supply route on July 7 when they advanced to within firing range of the Castello Road. They have since tightened the encirclement of the rebel-held east taking parts of the road itself and causing food shortages and spiralling prices in opposition neighbourhoods. Syrias Al Watan daily which is close to the government also reported advances in Leramun an industrial area that once housed scores of factories. State news agency SANA broadcast a call from the military urging residents of eastern Aleppo to \"join the national reconciliation and expel the foreign mercenaries\" from their neighbourhoods. It said the army had sent text messages to residents and fighters in the east urging rebels to lay down their weapons and identifying safe passages for civilians wishing to leave. Government forces continued to pound opposition areas on Tuesday with the observatory reporting a new barrel bomb attack on the district of Al Mashhad. It said five civilians including three children were killed. On Monday at least 24 people including five children and two women were killed in a barrel bomb attack on the same neighbourhood according to a new toll from the observatory. A statement from the UN childrens agency UNICEF on Tuesday condemned weekend air raids on four hospitals in Aleppo calling them a blatant violation of international humanitarian law that may amount to war crimes. On the humanitarian front a 48-truck aid convoy on Tuesday entered regime-besieged Talbiseh in Homs province with food and other supplies for 40000 people the International Committee of the Red Cross said. More than 280000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests that were met with a regime crackdown.\n",

      "Syrian government forces on Tuesday seized a rebel-held neighborhood in the northwest edge of Aleppo tightening their siege of opposition-controlled parts of the city a monitor said. The government also carried out renewed shelling attacks on opposition-held districts a day after bombardments killed at least 24 people the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based monitor said regime troops had full control of the Leramun district after heavy clashes. It also reported intense fighting for neighboring rebel-held district of Bani Zeid. The two areas have been used by rebels to launch rockets into government-held districts in the city's west.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aleppo has been roughly divided between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012. In recent weeks regime advances have severed the only remaining route into the rebel-held eastern neighborhoods effectively placing them under siege. Opposition forces have responded by firing missiles into government districts killing scores of civilians. \"The importance of capturing Leramun and Bani Zeid is to stop the missile fire and also to further tighten the siege\" said observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman. He said government forces had now surrounded Bani Zeid reporting heavy shelling in the area and clashes. The monitor had no immediate toll in the fighting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Government forces effectively severed the opposition's main supply route on July 7 when they advanced to within firing range of the Castello Road. They have since tightened the encirclement of the rebel-held east taking parts of the road itself and causing food shortages and spiraling prices in opposition neighborhoods. Syria's Al Watan daily which is close to the government also reported advances in Leramun an industrial area that once housed scores of factories.\n",
      "\n",
      "State news agency SANA broadcast a call from the military urging residents of eastern Aleppo to \"join the national reconciliation and expel the foreign mercenaries\" from their neighborhoods. It said the army had sent text messages to residents and fighters in the east urging rebels to lay down their weapons and identifying safe passages for civilians wishing to leave. Government forces continued to pound opposition areas on Tuesday with the observatory reporting a new shooting attack on the district of Al Mashhad. It said five civilians including three children were killed.\n",
      "\n",
      "On June 15, 2015, at least 24 people including five children and two women were killed in a shooting attack on the same neighborhood according to a new toll from the observatory.

      "Original article:  32 killed in Syrias Daraa Aleppo NGO Friday 15 Aug 2014 Print Tweet Views 458 Related Lebanon charges 43 Syrians with belonging to terrorist groups 2000 Syria refugees stranded in Lebanon mountains Nun Morocco busts jihadist Iraq Syria recruitment network At least 22 people were killed Friday when a car bomb exploded in front of a mosque in Daraa province of southern Syria the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Among the dead in the blast in the rebel-controlled town of Namar were a woman and a child the Britain-based monitoring group said. In northern Syria the Observatory reported 10 people killed when regime helicopters dropped explosive-packed \"barrel bombs\" on Aleppo city. The attacks targeted the Bab al-Nairab district of the Old City and the southern Salahin neighbourhood. North of Aleppo city the Observatory said jihadists from the Islamic State (IS) group extended their advances seizing Baghaydin village near the border with Turkey. On Wednesday IS fighters captured eight villages in the area between Aleppo and the border from rival rebel groups. Those advances came after clashes that killed at least 40 fighters from rebel groups as well as 12 IS fighters according to the Observatory. The successes open the way for IS to move towards two strategic prizes - Aazaz and Marea. Marea is a stronghold of the Islamic Front a coalition of Islamist groups that is among those fighting against IS. Aazaz sits next to a border crossing with Turkey which would be a valuable asset as IS seeks to expand its self-declared \"caliphate\" in the territory it holds in Syria and neighbouring Iraq. IS emerged from Al-Qaedas one-time branch in Iraq and initially fought alongside Syrias opposition including more moderate rebels and Al-Nusra fighters. But its abuses and harsh brand of religion prompted a backlash from rebel groups that pushed it out of many opposition-held areas earlier this year. Since then it has staged a comeback bolstered by weaponry obtained in advances across the border in Iraq. One analyst warned Friday that the fate of Syrias \"Western-backed opposition in northern Syria hangs quite literally on a knife-edge\" as IS advances in northern Aleppo and regime forces advance in Aleppo city. In an opinion piece published on CNNs website Charles Lister of the Brookings Doha Centre said Syrias rebels were facing an \"existential threat\". Lister said IS was likely to move into Aazaz cutting rebel supply lines to Syria and into Marea from which it could launch attacks on rebel-held parts of Aleppo city. Aleppo has been divided between rebel control in the east and regime control in the west since shortly after fighting began there in mid-2012. In the face of regime advances around the eastern outskirts of the city coupled with IS advances farther north the remaining rebels inside Aleppo are increasingly beleaguered. Fighting in the province has left civilians there \"living in appalling conditions\" the International Committee of the Red Cross said on Friday. The ICRC said it was working with Syrias Red Crescent to deliver medical aid to all parts of the province in both rebel- and regime-held territory. \"Stepping up aid distributions in the governorate has been the ICRCs priority ever since we established a permanent presence in the city over a year ago\" it said. More than 170000 people have been killed in Syria since the beginning of its conflict in March 2011 according to the Observatory.\n",

The death toll from twin the terrorist ugly explosions in the Syrian province of Homs rose to 32 and more than 115 wounded persons most of them children and several sustaining critical injuries. Two terrorist bombings hit an area near a school compound in Ikrima neighborhood in Homs city on Wednesday. A source in the central province said that terrorists detonated up a car bomb in front of the New Ikrima School and only a few minutes later a suicide bomber blew himself up in front of Ikrima al-Makhzoumi School. The attacks took place at the time when students were leaving school to inflict maximum casualties. The source pointed out that the car bomb was made up of three gas cylinders each packed with 7 kg of C4 explosives and concealed in a Mazda. Prime Minister Dr. Wael al-Halqi condemned the twin terrorist blasts that rocked Homs city on Wednesday. These terrorist acts in which terrorists have taken their hatred out on our schoolchildren are meant to discourage Syrias children from pursuing knowledge he told SANA. The terrorist groups have been taken aghast by the Syrian armys military successes the Premier said which accounts for their resort to these cowardly acts. Al-Halqi said these terrorist acts will make us even stronger and more determined to restore security and stability all over Syria. In the same context Regional leadership of al-Baath Arab Socialist Part strongly condemned the twin terrorist explosions that targeted the students. In a statement the Partys leadership said that the terrorist twin explosions reveal again the brutality of terrorists and their hatred against the Syrian citizens who achieved a lot of victories over terrorism. Homs governor Talal al-Barazi said targeting safe children in their schools is an act of cowardice and a desperate attempt to undermine the steadfastness of Syria and reverse the state of security and stability in Homs province. Al-Barazi whose comments came during a visit he paid to the hospitals where the injured from Wednesday twin terrorist bombings lay said the internal security forces have facilitated the movement of ambulances which rushed to the site of the explosion to evacuate the victims and rescue the wounded. Director of Homs Health Directorate Dr. Hassan al-Jundi said the health sector is on high alert to take all necessary measures under these extraordinary circumstances.

      "Original article:  Friday 19 Aug 2016 Syria regime pounds Kurdish positions for second day AFP Syrian regime warplanes bombarded the northeastern city of Hasakeh for the second day on Friday targeting positions held by Kurdish forces a monitor and a journalist in the city said. Fresh strikes came as the Pentagon said that US-led coalition fighter jets scrambled to protect Kurdish forces working with American advisers in Syria as they were targeted by regime planes Thursday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights - which monitors the conflict and determines which planes carry out raids according to their type location flight patterns and the munitions involved - said Fridays strikes were conducted by regime jets. The journalist in Hasakeh said eight air strikes could be heard throughout the day mostly focused in the citys southwestern neighbourhoods. Most of Hasakeh city the capital of the northeastern province by the same name is controlled by Kurdish forces while the rest is held by fighters loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. Since Wednesday clashes between the two forces have rocked the city leaving 23 civilians - including nine children - and 16 combattants dead the Observatory said. The Britain-based monitor said thousands of inhabitants had begun to flee Hasakeh where bread was running out and electricity supplies have been cut. Thursdays government raids on Hasakeh were the first time the regime had bombarded Kurdish positions from the air. The development prompted jets from the US-led coalition battling the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq to intervene in order to protect Kurdish forces working alongside US advisors a Pentagon spokesman said Friday. \"This was done as a measure to protect coalition forces\" Captain Jeff Davis said. \"We did make clear that US aircraft would defend troops on the ground if threatened.\" The Kurdish Peoples Protection Units (YPG) are a key US ally in the fight against IS. Washington regards them as the most effective fighting force on the ground in Syria and has provided weapons and special forces military advisers. IS controls most of the Euphrates valley to the south of Hasakeh and tensions between regime and Kurdish forces have sometimes led to armed clashes in spite of their common jihadist enemy. The Kurds who control much of northeastern and northern Syria along the Turkish border where they have proclaimed an autonomous Kurdish region recently demanded that the pro-government National Defence Forces disband in Hasakeh. A government source in the city told AFP that the air strikes were \"a message to the Kurds that they should stop this sort of demand that constitutes an affront to national sovereignty\".

      "Original article:  Air strikes kill 11 including children in Syrias Idlib monitor AFP Wednesday 13 Jul 2016 At least 11 civilians including three children were killed in air strikes on a rebel-held town in Syrias northwestern Idlib province on Wednesday a monitor said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said it was unclear if the strikes on the town of Ariha in Idlib province were carried out by Syrian government or Russian war planes. The town is controlled by the Army of Conquest a rebel alliance of mainly Islamist groups including Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front that holds almost all of Idlib province. Video uploaded by activists purportedly showed the aftermath of the strikes with residents and civil defence workers picking though debris looking for survivors. Idlib has regularly been targeted by both Syrian government air strikes and raids carried out by its Russian ally. A longtime backer of the government in Damascus Moscow stepped up its support for President Bashar al-Assad on September 30 when it began an air campaign aimed at bolstering regime positions. Elsewhere in the country the Observatory said at least eight people were killed on Wednesday in the town of Rastan in central Homs province. Five of them died in air strikes on the towns market place which also wounded dozens of people. Another three were killed in shelling earlier Wednesday.\n",

      "TWICE EXTRACTED ARTICLE:  Air strikes kill 11 including children in Syria's Damascus monitor AFP Wednesday 13 Jul 2016 At least 11 civilians including three children were killed in air strikes on a rebel-held town in Syria's capital city of Damascus on Wednesday a monitor said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said it was unclear if the strikes on the town were carried out by Russian forces. Video uploaded by activists purportedly showed the aftermath of the strikes with residents and civil defence workers picking though debris looking for survivors. Elsewhere in the country the Observatory said at least eight people were killed on Wednesday in the town of Rastan in central Homs province. Five of them died in air strikes on the towns market place which also wounded dozens of people. Another three were killed in shelling earlier Wednesday.\n",

      "Original article:  Last updated at Jun 182016 BEIRUT At least seven people died in rebel shelling of a neighbourhood of the Syrian city of Aleppo held by the Kurdish YPG militia at dawn on Saturday a monitoring group said as rebels took territory to the south. More than 40 people were also wounded in the attack on the Sheikh Maqsoud area the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a district next to the only way in and out of rebel-held parts of the northern city the Castello road. An escalation in air and artillery strikes in recent weeks around the road has made it virtually impassable putting hundreds of thousands of people in Aleppo under effective siege. Hundreds of people have been killed in Aleppo since peace talks broke off in April as Syrias President Bashar Assad seeks to regain control of what was Syrias largest pre-war city now split between rebel and government sectors. Rebels have said in the past their attacks on Sheikh Maqsoud were in response to YPG attempts to cut the Castello road. The YPG controls nearly all of Syrias northern frontier with Turkey and has been a close ally of the United States in the campaign against Daesh in Syria. Many rebels in western Syria do not trust the YPG because they say it cooperates with Damascus rather than fighting it an accusation the YPG has denied Heavy bombardment Sheikh Maqsoud has been under intense bombardment since mid-February which has killed more than 132 civilians and injured around 900 more the observatory said. A 48-hour ceasefire in Aleppo announced by Russia on Thursday has had little impact on fighting and air strikes and shelling have continued in and around the city since then. Three people two of them children died and more than nine people were injured by barrel bombs dropped from helicopters in the city the observatory said on Saturday. The White Helmets a group of civil defence emergency workers operating in rebel-held areas said on Twitter one of their buildings in Haritan in the north Aleppo countryside was hit by an air strike on Saturday. There were no injuries. The observatory also said on Saturday that rebels had captured three villages south of Aleppo from government control Zeitan Khalsa and Barna causing significant losses among government forces and their allies. The villages are near a main highway within rebel territory linking Aleppo with the capital Damascus to the south. They lie in an area captured by government forces at the end of last year in a large offensive assisted by Iranian-backed militias and Russian airpower. But the Syrian observatory said there has been a lack of Russian air support during this weeks battle for these villages. At least 86 members of Syrian government forces and its allies who include members of the Lebanese group Hizbollah and other Iranian-backed militias were killed in fighting in the south Aleppo area in the past four days the observatory said. The numbers could not be independently confirmed. The rebels are fighting alongside Al Qaeda-affiliated Al Nusra Front which like the Daesh terror group was excluded from a February ceasefire and from the Geneva peace talks.\n",

Here are some details about the city which was the site of a massacre in 1982: * 1982: - In the late 1970s and early 1980s Syrias Muslim Brotherhood sought to destabilize and unseat President Hafez al-Assad and his government through political assassinations and urban guerilla warfare. In February 1982 the Muslim Brotherhood ambushed government forces searching for dissidents in Hama. - Syrian government forces attacked the city razing the old quarters of Hama to crush the armed uprising by Brotherhood fighters who had taken refuge there. - Estimates of the death toll in the three weeks of operations in Hama vary from 10000 to more than 30000 out of a population of 350000. Syria then imprisoned much of the membership of the local Islamist group. - Syrian human rights groups said that women children and the elderly were among those killed in the crackdown and thousands were forced to flee the city. * 2011: - In June activists said Syrian forces killed at least 60 protesters in the city.

Syria condemned the action and summoned them to Damascus on July 10. - Ford had only arrived in Damascus in January.

      "Original article:  Syria rebel infighting kills 45 fighters in 2 days AP Monday 9 Jun 2014 Activists say rebel infighting in Syria has killed 45 opposition fighters over the past two days. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the fighting flared up in eastern Deir el-Zour province on Sunday and continued into Monday. The Observatory says the clashes pitted al-Qaidas affiliate the Nusra Front against the al-Qaida breakaway Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The two jihadi groups were allies but had a falling out earlier this year and have since intermittently clashed in some of the fiercest rebel infighting in the Syrian civil war. The Observatory says a month of infighting in Dier el-Zour alone has killed nearly 300 fighters and displaced 100000 civilians. It has also weakened the Syrian oppositions resolve to overthrow President Bashar Assad.\n",

Areas hit included a market and at least five children were among those killed the British-based Observatory said. It said the death toll was expected to rise because of the number of people seriously wounded. It said it did not know whether Syrian or Russian jets had carried out the strikes. Both are operating in the area. Russia deployed warplanes to Syria last year to support President Bashar al-Assad against rebels seeking to end his rule and have supported Syrian government forces in a separate fight against Islamic State (IS) group further east. Idlib city and the province by the same name is a stronghold of rebel groups including the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. Air raids in the town of Maarat al-Numan about 30 km (20 miles) south of Idlib killed another six people the Observatory said. There has been heavy bombardment of areas in Idlib province in recent weeks including air strikes that killed at least 23 people last month. Fighting in Syrias five-year civil war has intensified since a February ceasefire deal which took hold in the west of the country but excluded al Qaeda and IS group but quickly began to unravel.\n",

      "Original article:  Tuesday 02 August 2016 19:11 Syrian Coalition Demands UN Action under Chapter VII Following Regime Chlorine Attacks on Saraqib Idlib Twitter font size Activists said regime forces bombed the town of Saraqib in rural Idlib with chlorine-filled barrel bombs on Monday causing over 30 cases of asphyxiation among civilians. The attacks were carried out in a blatant violation of UN Security Council resolutions 2118 and 2235 banning the use of chemical weapons and toxic substances. In a press release issued earlier on Tuesday the Syrian Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to shoulder its responsibilities towards stopping such attacks. It stressed that urgent measures must be taken under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations to protect the Syrian people. Any further delay in taking firm stance towards such attacks will open the door to more crimes and violations by the Assad regime the Coalition said. Separately over 12 civilians were killed and dozens injured including women and children when Russian jets raided the village of Abu Alduhour in rural Idlib on Monday. Five civilians were also killed in similar attacks on the village of Tal Toughan in rural Idlib. Activists said that the bombings were carried out by Russian forces in revenge for the death of five crewmen killed when their helicopter crashed near the town of Saraqib on Monday. The Syrian Coalition emphasized the need for the international community to assume its responsibilities regarding the protection of civilians in accordance with International Law (IL) and International Humanitarian Law (IHL) to stop war crimes and eliminate the constant threat of the use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime.

      "Original article:  Last updated at Jul 012016 BEIRUT At least 70 regime and rebel fighters have been killed in 24 hours in a government assault and an extremist-led counterattack in northern Syria a monitor said Thursday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 30 regime soldiers and 39 rebel fighters had been killed in battles around Al Maleh north of Aleppo since Wednesday afternoon. Extremists fighting for Al Nusra Front the Syrian branch of Al Qaeda were also killed said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman who did not provide a precise number. The government of President Bashar Assad has been attempting to seize Al Maleh for more than two years. His forces have been trying for months to surround Aleppo by cutting supply lines between rebel-held districts of the city and nearby Turkey which supports opposition forces. For nearly a week regime troops backed by Syrian and Russian warplanes have been battling for control of Al Maleh. Assads regime is also attempting to cut the Castello Road a key supply route from the Turkish border to rebel-held eastern suburbs of Aleppo. The pro-regime website Al Masdar News reported that the Syrian army withdrew from the farms of Al Maleh as they faced a rebel counter-offensive led by Al Nusra Front. It said rebels attacked government forces with two suicide car bombs. The observatory said two children were killed by regime bombs in a rebel-held area of Aleppo. The majority of Aleppo province is controlled by Al Nusra and its Islamist allies while the city the countrys pre-war commercial capital has been divided since July 2012 into rebel-held and regime-held areas. Five civilians including three children were also killed by regime bombs that landed on eastern Ghouta the observatory reported on Thursday.\n",

      "Last updated at Jul 012016 BEIRUT At least 70 regime and rebel fighters have been killed in 24 hours in a government assault and an extremist-led counterattack in northern Syria a monitor said Thursday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 30 regime soldiers and 39 rebel fighters had been killed in battles around Al Maleh north of Aleppo since Wednesday afternoon. Extremists fighting for Al Nusra Front the Syrian branch of Al Qaeda were also killed said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman who did not provide a precise number. The government of President Bashar Assad has been attempting to seize Al Maleh for more than two years. His forces have been trying for months to surround Aleppo by cutting supply lines between rebel-held districts of the city and nearby Turkey which supports opposition forces. For nearly a week Russian Forces backed by Syrian warplanes have been battling for control of Al Maleh. Assads regime is also attempting to cut the Castello Road a key supply route from the Turkish border to rebel-held eastern suburbs of Aleppo. The pro-regime website Al Masdar News reported that Russian Forces withdrew from the farms of Al Maleh as they faced a rebel counter-offensive led by Al Nusra Front. It said rebels attacked government forces with two suicide car bombs. The observatory said two children were killed by regime bombs in a rebel-held area of Aleppo. The majority of Aleppo province is controlled by Al Nusra and its Islamist allies while the city the countrys pre-war commercial capital has been divided since July 2012 into rebel-held and regime-held areas. Five civilians including three children were also killed by regime bombs that landed on Daraa the observatory reported on Thursday.\n",

      "Original article:  Posted on July 20 2016 by Asharq Al-Awsat Dozens Killed in International Coalition Airstrikes on Manbij A day after the first massacre that took place in the Al-Hazawiya neighbourhood in Manbij the Aleppo countryside airstrikes led by the international coalition have killed dozens of people and injured others in Tokhar according to the Syrian National Coalition and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The ISIS run Amaq news agency said that 160 civilians were killed in raids on the Manbij countryside whilst an international coalition source did not deny that airstrikes had been carried out in Manbij recently and said that an investigation into the matter is being carried out. The source told Asharq Al-Awsat that. We have seen the reports that indicate that people were killed as a result of the shelling and we are now collecting information on the matter from several parties some of which were close to the sites that were targeted. Based on the results we will take necessary measures. We would like to stress that we take precautions and measures to avoid targeting civilians and minimise the harm that may affect them. Meanwhile the US military announced in a statement that opposition fighters that are backed by the United States and are fighting ISIS militants in Syria took control of a base from which operations were led in the city of Manbij at the beginning of the week. The Director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP that the bombing carried out by the international coalition targeted the outskirts of the village of Tokhar at dawn yesterday which resulted in 56 civilians dying including 11 children. Other Syrian opposition websites stated that the death toll has risen to 85 people including five entire families most of which were women and children after residential areas were targeted. Opposition websites also stated that the bombing resulted in the destruction of a mill and a number of mosques and schools.

      "Original article:  Published August 15 2016 SEND httpsabahdai.lyraA1yc A Syrian man covered with dust carries pieces of metal on a street cluttered with rubble following an airstrike on the rebel-held neighborhood of Sakhur in Aleppo. DAESH said that it killed at least 50 opposition fighters in a suicide bombing on a bus near the Atmeh border crossing with Turkey. The opposition faces the DAESH threat while fighting intensively against the Syrian regime in Idlib and Aleppo DAESH said on Monday they were responsible for a suicide bombing on a bus on Sunday which killed fighters from western-backed Syrian opposition groups near the Atmeh border crossing with Turkey. In a statement on one of its Telegram channels the hard-line militant group said it killed 50 fighters travelling on the bus from the Failaq al-sham and the al-Zinki groups. It said the fighters were travelling to fight against DAESH in northern Aleppo province. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a suicide bomber struck a bus transporting fighters through the Atmeh border post one of several crossings Syrian opposition uses to bring in fighters and supplies. The monitoring group which relies on activists inside Syria said the attack killed 50 fighters. An activist who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution said some 200 fighters from various factions are based near Atmeh and bring in weapons through the crossing. The Observatory had earlier reported 26 airstrikes on Sunday across Idlib one of the last remaining opposition bastions. Observatory head Rami Abdurrahman said Russian and government airstrikes on the province have intensified since opposition fighters launched a campaign from Idlib to break a government siege of Aleppos opposition districts on July 31. The strikes have killed 122 civilians he said. Another 327 civilians including 126 children have been killed in fighting in Aleppo province according to the Observatory. The toll includes 126 people killed by opposition shelling of government-held parts of Aleppo city. The Local Coordination Committees an activist network said Russian jets struck the towns of Jisr al-Shaghour and Binnish while the Observatory reported strikes on the provincial capital Idlib. It was unclear how the activists identified the planes. Aleppo is still home to some 2 million people most of whom live in the government-controlled western districts. Syrian government forces on Monday repelled a renewed opposition assault southwest of the city of Aleppo forcing opposition forces to retreat from positions they seized a daily earlier the Syrian government and activists said. The development followed intense battles between the two sides. Tens of thousands of Syrians displaced from Aleppo have found refuge in Idlib home to a pre-war population of 1.5 million. On Sunday evening opposition fighters opened a new front sending a truck bomb into Aleppos western Zahraa neighborhood according to the Twitter account of the Islamic Front one of the factions fighting for the city. The Observatory reported fighting in the citys western and southern districts. Moscow has been waging an air campaign in support of government forces for nearly a year. Russias military said six long-range Tu-22M3 bombers that took off from Russian territory carried out strikes Sunday on DAESH near the eastern Syrian city of Deir el-Zour. It made no mention of any strikes in Idlib. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Monday that Syrian opposition groups had used temporary ceasefires in and around Aleppo to regroup and rearm. Lavrov speaking at a news conference in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg with his German counterpart Frank-Walter Steinmeier said he realized that brief daily ceasefires in place now to allow aid to enter and civilians to leave were not sufficient. But he said it was difficult to make the ceasefires longer for the moment because of the risk of militants using them to regroup and rearm something he said they had done in the past. German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said the hardships faced by people in Aleppo could not be alleviated by announcing three-hour ceasefires. \"Its supposed to sound like a concession but its actually cynicism because everybody knows that this amount of time is nowhere near sufficient to actually build up supplies for the desperate people there\" he told a government news conference. He said the killing in Aleppo had to stop and the city needed to receive food and medical items without hindrance. Seibert said Syrias Bashar Assad and Russia an ally of Assad against opposition in Syrias five-year-old civil war were largely responsible for the situation in the city \"Its primarily their decision whether there will be further deaths or whether the people there get help and hope after months of suffering.\"\n",

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said five children were among the dead on Monday in the rebel-held district of Marjeh in east Aleppo. Dozens more people were wounded or still trapped under rubble. Of the 45 civilians killed the highest number of dead were in Qaterji where Russian raids claimed 17 lives overnight said Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman.

      "Air raids kill at least 12 civilians in Syria's Damascus Monitor AFP Monday 17 Oct 2016 Air strikes killed at least 12 civilians in Syria's Damascus on Monday a monitor said bringing to 45 the number killed in 24 hours of bombardment on the battleground city. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said five children were among the dead on Monday in the rebel-held district of Marjeh in Damascus. Dozens more people were wounded or still trapped under rubble. Of the 45 civilians killed, the highest number of dead were in Qaterji where Russian raids claimed 17 lives overnight said Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. An AFP correspondent in the eastern districts said White Helmets rescuers were still working Monday morning to pull about 20 people out of the rubble in Qaterji. One civil defence volunteer said they had been unable to complete rescue missions overnight in fear of further air strikes by warplanes circling above. Both Russian and Syrian warplanes are carrying out air strikes over Damascus in support of a major offensive by regime forces to capture rebel-held parts of the northern city. The Observatory - which relies on a network of sources inside Syria for its information - says it determines what planes carried out raids according to their type, location, flight patterns, and the munitions involved. However, the exact reason for the shelling remains unclear.\n",

Tags Syria Eastern Ghouta Douma Syrian regime bombing Siege White Helmets Three rescue workers from the Syrian Civil Defence - better known as the White Helmets - have been killed in bombing in a besieged Damascus suburb the group said on Friday. The men were killed as they provided aid to civilians injured in bombing in Syrias Eastern Ghouta region when the air strike took place. Other workers from the rescue team were also injured in the attack the group said with four children and one man killed in earlier regime shelling. \"The civil defence [White Helmets] condemns the bombing and raids on the cities and towns of eastern Ghouta which focuses on targeting civilian centres and aid workers\" the group said in a statement. \"Today the regime air force targeted [a] Syrian civil defence team [as they were] working in Douma city. Three volunteers were killed and most of the other volunteers were injured.\" Siege Watch claimed the workers were targeted by a \"guided missile\" which follows routine \"double tap\" attacks on bomb sites as rescue workers attempt to save survivors. Opposition Damascus suburb Eastern Ghouta has been subject to ferocious bombing and shelling by the Syrian regime this week. At least six children were among 12 civilians killed in the district during bombing and shelling on Friday Siege Watch reported. The White Helmets said that 45 people have been killed and 307 injured in three days of regime attacks on Eastern Ghouta. These include the use of 38 banned cluster bombs drone attacks hundreds of shells and five surface-to-surface missiles. Eastern Ghouta is also subject to a horrific siege which is starving the civilian population and leaving them without desperately needed medical equipment and medicine activists and NGOs say. White Helmets volunteers are the first on the scene at sites hit by bombs and shells with scores killed in subsequent attacks.

The Syrian Coalition condemns the massacre committed by ISIS militants against elements of the FSA in the town of Al Bab northeast of Aleppo and in Joban Bai near the Syrian-Turkish borders. Activists said that around 41 FSA rebels were rounded up and executed by the extremist group in the first day of Eid al-Fitr. We call on the international community to support the FSA as it is the only disciplined and organized revolutionary force that it is committed to achieving the goals of the revolution and defending the Syrian people against the massacres of Assad and ISIS. This is also the only viable option to prevent the expansion of ISIS which is seeking to enforce its own agenda in Syria and the region.

      "Original article:  Friday 10 July 2015 19:14 ISIS Continues to Displace Locals in Rural Deir Ezzor. The Syrian Network for Human Rights said in a report released today that ISIS had forced at least 33000 residents out of their homes in the town of Abu Hamam in rural Deir Ezzor since 10 August 2014. According to report ISIS has executed around 367 people in the town while 240 more have gone missing. The Syrian Coalition has previously condemned the heinous crime committed by ISIS in eastern rural Deir Ezzor where residents discovered a mass grave containing 230 corpses of tribesmen who were summarily executed by ISIS in late 2014. The area was the scene of fierce battles between the Shaitat tribesmen and ISIS militants who eventually took control of the area and rounded up hundreds of tribesmen and executed them on charges of apostasy. The Syrian Coalition stresses that modern dictatorships have left nothing but a legacy of mass graves death and destruction. Four years have passed since Assad embarked on his brutal campaign on the Syrian people and now ISIS to pursue the same campaign and one can hardly find any difference between the two in terms of the scale of their criminality and barbarity. Despite the unprecedented sacrifices Syrians are determined to move forward in their revolution with the aim of building a state justice law freedom and dignity for all its citizens.

Tags Syria Aleppo Russia airstrikes US ceasefire Hundreds of people including civilians have been killed as Russian and Syrian jets continued on Monday to pound rebel-held areas of Syrias Aleppo for the fourth day in a row. The death toll reached 330 overnight civil defence sources told The New Arab as airstrikes targeted the citys opposition-controlled areas after midnight on Sunday. \"Hospitals that are still in service are under a lot of pressure due to the significant number of wounded in recent days and the major shortage of blood\" one medic told AFP. \"Because of this serious injuries are requiring immediate amputations.\" The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights placed the death toll lower saying \"at least 128 people\" nearly all civilians had been killed in the raids since Thursday. Among the dead were 20 children and nine women said Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman. At least 36 civilians including 11 children and five women were killed in raids targeting rural areas of Aleppo province he said. \t \tHospitals that are still in service are under a lot of pressure due to the significant number of wounded in recent days.\t \t Hospitals in rebel-held east Aleppo are struggling to deal with a huge number of casualties as supplies dwindle. Monday was the fourth day of intense air raids on the city after a defiant Syrian regime launched a new assault to retake the entirety of the city following the collapse of a short-lived ceasefire brokered by Russia and the United States. With Aleppo again under siege - regime forces fully surrounded the city in early September - residents have to deal with food shortages and skyrocketing prices as well as the increased violence. \t \tIn pictures Click here for Zouhir al-Shimales photoessay on East Aleppos empty marketplace The price of a portion of bread had risen to 500 Syrian pounds ($1) from 350 Syrian pounds last week and food is becoming increasingly difficult to find.
