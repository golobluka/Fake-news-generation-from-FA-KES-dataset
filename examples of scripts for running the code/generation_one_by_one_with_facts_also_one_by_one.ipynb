The Takfiri ISIL group has executed at least 24 civilians after seizing a village in northern Syria from a US-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance a monitor said Friday. The Takfiri ISIL group has executed at least 24 civilians after seizing a village in northern Syria from a US-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance a monitor said Friday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said ISIL executed 24 civilians \"in the last 24 hours\" after taking Buyir from the Syrian Democratic Forces. The village is located some 10 kilometers (6 miles) northwest of Manbij a key waypoint between the Turkish border and the ISIL de facto capital of Raqa city. ISIL seized control of several villages in the countryside northwest of Manbij since launching a \"fierce assault\" on Thursday according to the Britain-based Observatory. The so-called SDF backed by air strikes from a US-led coalition launched an offensive to retake Manbij from IS on May 31. The alliance managed to enter the town but have since faced fierce opposition from the Takfiris who have fought back with suicide bombers and car bombs. \n",

      "Original article:  Workers dig out dead after Syria regime strike on Aleppo AFP Tuesday 30 Sep 2014 At least eight people were killed on Tuesday among them four children when Syrian regime helicopters dropped explosives-packed barrel bombs on a district of northern Aleppo a monitoring group said. The attack between the neighbourhoods of Sakhur and Sheikh Khodr caused widespread damage levelling several buildings and shearing the facades off others. Civil defence members in the rebel-held east of the city rushed to the scene using bulldozers and pickaxes to clear rubble and twisted metal. Some local residents also pitched in to help as others could only looked on dazed at the destruction. The emergency crews partly unearthed one body which appeared to be that of a teenager clad in pink trousers visible under thick dust. Not far away they worked to remove rubble from around another body a small arm that appeared to be that of a child emerging from the shattered brickwork. \"The strike here was this morning. Can you show me even one person here from the Free Syrian Army (rebel fighters)?\" asked Jihad who survived the bombing. \"The people here were all women and children who were sleeping\" he said. Shuhud al-Hussein a member of the civil defence forces said his team had rushed to the scene after hearing the sound of the barrel bomb explosion. \"A helicopter dropped two barrels\" he said. \"This area doesnt have any military groups in it at all its just residents women and children\" Hussein said. \"Were trying to help the people here we were able to pull two children out alive thank God\" he added.\n",

      "Original article:  5 Sep 2016 At least 42 people were killed and dozens more wounded in simultaneous bomb blasts that hit Tartous Homs and Hasakeh cities of Syria. A general view shows the damage at a site of an explosion in Bab Tadmor in Homs Syria in this handout picture provided by SANA on September 5 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) A string of bomb blasts hit mostly regime-controlled areas of Syria on Monday killing at least 42 people and wounding dozens more local media said. The blasts hit regime-held Tartous and Homs as well as Hasakeh which is mostly controlled by the PKKs Syrian affiliate YPG. Regime media said at least 30 people had been killed and 45 injured in a double bomb attack just outside the city of Tartous in the coastal province of the same name which is a stronghold of Bashar al-Assads regime. A car bomb exploded on the Arzuna bridge followed by a suicide bomber who detonated his explosive belt when people gathered to help the wounded Syrian regime television said. No individual or group claimed responsibility for the attacks. Tartous which also hosts a Russian military base has largely been spared the worst violence of Syrias conflict since it began with pro-democracy protests in March 2011. Bab Tadmor Homs - SANA pic.twitter.comwAOZTxImcu Hassan Ridha (sayedridha) September 5 2016 Regime media also reported that eight people were killed in a bombing in Hasakeh in the northeast of the country. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitor said the blast hit a checkpoint under the control of the YPG. Hasakeh city has been regularly targeted by DAESH including in July when a bomber on a motorcycle killed at least 16 people outside a bakery in the city. The terrorist group has been losing ground to the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces which is mainly comprised of the YPG even though its affiliate organisation the PKK is listed as a terrorist organisation by Turkey the US and the EU. More recently DAESH has also lost territory to Turkish-backed Free Syria Army (FSA) fighters. Over the weekend advances by the Turkish Army and Free Syria Army (FSA) fighters expelled DAESH from the last stretch of the Syrian-Turkish border under their control. (TRT World and Agencies) Turkish Armed Forces launched Operation Euphrates Shield on August 24 to protect its borders and secure the Turkish town of Karkamis adjoining Syria from DAESH attacks. Simultaneous attacks In central Homs city regime media said at least three people were killed in a car bomb at the entrance to the Al-Zahraa neighbourhood whose residents mostly belong to the same Alawite sect as Assad. Al-Zahraa has also been regularly targeted in bomb attacks including a devastating double bomb blast in February that killed 57 people and was claimed by DAESH. Syrian regime soldiers stand at a site of an explosion in Bab Tadmor in Homs Syria in this handout picture provided by SANA on September 5 2016. (TRT World and Agencies) Regime television broadcast images from the aftermath of the blast in Homs showing rubble strewn on the streets and smoke rising from the charred remains of vehicles. Another bomb attack was also reported on the Al-Sabura road west of the capital Damascus with regime media saying one person had been killed and three injured in that bombing. The Observatory said that the attack targeted a checkpoint and gave a death toll of three. Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said the blasts appeared to be coordinated. \"Clearly these attacks were simultaneous and they all targeted security posts\" he told AFP. More than 290000 people have been killed in Syria since the war started and millions have been displaced by the fighting. Successive rounds of international negotiations aimed at finding a political solution have failed to bear fruit but US Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov are due to resume discussions on stemming the violence on Monday.

Most of the dead were civilians on the ground in the town in Idlib province which fell to a coalition of Islamist insurgents in May according to the UK-based Observatory for Human Rights which tracks violence across Syria. Scores were also injured it said. There was no immediate reaction from the Syrian army. The Local Coordination Committees said the warplane crashed in a busy market in Ariha adding that it was not immediately clear whether the warplane was shot down. Rami Abdurrahman who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the warplane crashed in the center of the town destroying several homes and killing at least 12 people. The town of Ariha once a government stronghold was captured by opposition fighters and ISIS militants in May. The town is in the northwestern province of Idlib where government forces have suffered setbacks since March including the loss of the provincial capital which is also called Idlib. Syrian warplane crashes into market in northwest town of Ariha near Turkish border 35 killed - YouTube The Observatory and the Local Coordination Committees said that at the time of the crash the town was under attack by the air force of embattled Syrian President Bashar Assad.

      "Original article:  July 30 2014 Bombs in Syrias Aleppo kill 13 pro-Assad fighters: monitor. Opposition forces in Syria exploded bombs in tunnels under Aleppo late on Tuesday and killed at least 13 fighters loyal to President Bashar al-Assad in the northern city a group tracking the violence said. The bombs were placed in two tunnels running under historic parts of the city close to an old police station said the Observatory a Britain-based group which reports on Syria using a network of sources on the ground. The attack appeared to have been carried out by Islamic brigades fighting Assad it said. The blast killed government soldiers and other forces fighting alongside them the Observatory added without giving details. Syrias state news agency made no mention of the attack. Aleppo is one of Syrias main contested cities and government forces took strategic ground around it in June squeezing the main rebel supply line into the city after months of battlefield gains by Damascus. The government advance was backed by fighters from the Lebanese Shiite Muslim group Hezbollah an ally of President Bashar al-Assad sources close to the group told Reuters earlier this month. Rebels advanced into Aleppo once Syrias commercial hub in 2012 from the north and took districts in the center of the city. The army has since mainly held the west and south of Aleppo but has been unable to push out opposition fighters. Forces loyal to Assad now control most of Damascus along with the main highway from the capital through to Homs and the western Mediterranean coast. Opposition fighters including a powerful al Qaeda offshoot Islamic State control much of the desert in the north and east.

The Kurdish forces have continued their advance on the town of Azaz in Northern Aleppo province a key Turkey-backed stronghold and supply point. On 15 Feb 2016 Turkish Prime Minister Ahmed Davutoglu said Ankara will not allow the town of Azaz in northern Syria to fall to the Kurdish YPG forces and promised the \"harshest reaction\" if the group attempts to re-take the city. From past month turkey started shelling Kurdish YPG fighters who raids Syrian rebels from a Menagh military air base south of the town of Azaz and near the Turkish border. The Menagh base had previously been controlled by the Ahrar ash-Sham rebel group which seized it in August of 2013. Ahrar ash-Sham militants at the base had been supported by Al-Nusra terrorists and some extremist groups coming from Turkey.The town is highly valued as a logistical supply route close to the TurkishSyrian border. Peshmerga shoot dead six ISIS suicide bombers west of Kirkuk In a separate event A major suicide attack by so-called Islamic State (ISIS ISIL IS Daesh ) terror Group on Peshmerga defense lines south of Kirkuk was foiled Saturday morning said the frontline commander. The militants were gunned down before they could detonate themselves commander Kamal Kirkuki told Rudaw. \"Six ISIS suicide bombers attacked the Peshmerga base at around 330 am whose bodies still lie there in the open field said Kirkuki.\" The bodies of the suicide bombers were blown to pieces after they were shot he added. If the Peshmerga had not killed the militants the attack would have caused serious casualties he said. The frontline south and west of Kirkuk has experienced major confrontations between ISIS and Kurdish forces in the last two years. But the Peshmerga are well-prepared for such surprise attacks said Kirkuki. He claimed that at least 6000 ISIS militants have been killed on this front. 12\n",

      "Original article:  Jihadists execute three Syria rebel officers Monitor AFP Saturday 21 Jun 2014 Jihadists from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) have executed three officers of the Western and Arab-backed rebel Free Syrian Army a monitor said Saturday. The bullet-riddled bodies of the three were found on Friday two days after suspected Islamist militants kidnapped them in the oil-rich eastern province of Deir Ezzor said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. ISIL which grew from the ranks of Al-Qaeda before splitting with the global terror network is active in both Syria and neighbouring Iraq and seeks to set up an Islamic state that straddles both countries. But the radical group has faced a major backlash from other rebels fighting to topple the Syrian regime and from Al-Qaedas affiliate in Syria Al-Nusra Front amid accusations of atrocities in Syrias three-year war. The FSA this month called for help from \"friendly and brotherly Arab nations\" to fight ISIL in Deir Ezzor. Rebels in Syria including Al-Nusra Front militants have been battling ISIL since the start of the year in fighting that has reportedly killed more than 6000 people. The clashes have mostly raged in the north and east of the country and on Friday ISIL seized control of the areas of Hafez and Muhassen in Deir Ezzor. The FSA officers executed by the jihadists had been kidnapped in Hafez the Britain-based Observatory said. ISIL has been battling Iraqi government forces since June 9 when in launched a lightening offensive in the north of the country.\n",

      "Jihadists execute three Syrian civilians Monitor AFP Saturday 21 Jun 2014 Jihadists from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) have executed three civilians in Tartus, a monitor said Saturday. The bullet-riddled bodies of the three were found on Friday two days after suspected Islamist militants kidnapped them, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. ISIL which grew from the ranks of Al-Qaeda before splitting with the global terror network is active in both Syria and neighboring Iraq and seeks to set up an Islamic state that straddles both countries. But the radical group has faced a major backlash from other rebels fighting to topple the Syrian regime and from Al-Qaedas affiliate in Syria Al-Nusra Front amid accusations of atrocities in Syrias three-year war. The civilian victims of this execution were not named. Rebels in Syria including Al-Nusra Front militants have been battling ISIL since the start of the year in fighting that has reportedly killed more than 6000 people. The clashes have mostly raged in the north and east of the country and on Friday ISIL seized control of the areas of Hafez and Muhassen in Deir Ezzor. ISIL has been battling Iraqi government forces since June 9 when it launched a lightning offensive in the north of the country.\n",

At least four civilians were killed in the city of Arbin and one was killed in each of the cities of Harasta and Douma and the towns of Mesraba Al-Hazza and Jesreen sources from Syrian civil-defense units also known as the \"White Helmets\" told Anadolu Agency anonymously due to security concerns. The airstrikes left dozens of civilians wounded who were transported to hospitals in the area the sources added. Since the beginning of last week eastern Ghouta has been under intensive strikes by regime forces that resulted in the killing of more than 70 people and injuring of many others. The Syrian regime has been stepping up its attacks on Eastern Ghouta even though the district falls within a network of de-escalation zones - endorsed by Turkey Russia and Iran - in which acts of aggression are expressly prohibited. Syria has only just begun to emerge from a devastating civil war that began in early 2011 when the Assad regime cracked down on pro-democracy protests with unexpected ferocity. Since then hundreds of thousands of people have been killed in the fighting and more than 10 million displaced according to the UN.\n",

The monitoring group updated its earlier death toll of 15 for the strike on Urum al-Joz saying three more people had died of serious injuries. It said the strike was believed to have been carried out by Russian planes which operate in support of the Assad regime. The Observatory which relies on a network of sources inside Syria for its information says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used. Idlib province is controlled by an opposition alliance and is regularly targeted by both the Assad regime and its Russian ally. Earlier this week a chemical attack hit the town of Khan Sheikhun in Idlib killing at least 87 civilians including 31 children.

The Turkish military has saaid four of its soldiers have been killed and four others have been injured in an attack by the Daesh Takfiri terrorist group in northern Syria. In a statement carried by Turkeys NTV television on Tuesday the army said the casualties came after a Daesh rocket attack on two of its tanks south of the town of al-Rai near the Turkish border. The fatalities were the first of Turkeys recent incursion into Syria to be blamed on Daesh. The Turkish television showed pictures of military helicopters flying across the Turkish-Syrian border to take the wounded to Turkey for treatment. Separately two pro-Turkey Syria militants were killed and two others sustained injuries in clashes in the same region the Turkish army statement added. On August 24 Turkish special forces tanks and jets backed by planes from the US-led coalition launched their first coordinated offensive in Syria. Damascus denounced the intervention as a breach of its sovereignty. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the operation dubbed \"Euphrates Shield\" was aimed at terror groups such as Daesh and the Democratic Union Party (PYD) a US-backed Kurdish group based in Syria. Hours after the beginning of the offensive Turkish-backed militants seized the city of Jarablus with Ankara saying that it wanted to establish a safe zone in the 98-kilometer (61-mile) area stretching from Jarablus to the city of Azaz; Press TV reported. 218-11\n",

The spokesman for the Free Syrian Army's (FSA) political bureau Abu Firas al-Suri, his son, and at least 20 other terrorists were killed in shelling Sunday in the northeast of the country. A monitor group said. \"Abu Firas al-Suri, his son, and at least 20 jihadists from Al-Nusra and Jund al-Aqsa and jihadists from Uzbekistan were killed in shelling on positions in Idleb province\" UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights chief Rami Abdel Rahman said in a statement. The monitor said it was not immediately clear if the raids were carried out by USA forces or their FSA allies. Abdel Rahman indicated that Suri was meeting with other leading terrorists in Kafar Jales when the shelling took place. Two other Al-Nusra and Jund al-Aqsa targets were also hit, and many were seriously injured he added.\n",

      "Original article:  Tuesday 19 Jul 2016 US-led strikes kill 56 civilians in Syria Monitor AFP Children were among at least 56 civilians killed in strikes by a US-led coalition early on Tuesday near a Syrian village held by the Islamic State (IS) group a monitor said. \"There are at least 56 dead including 11 children and dozens more wounded including some in critical condition\" said Rami Abdel Rahman director of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The monitor said that the civilians were hit as they were fleeing fighting in the Aleppo province village of Al-Tukhar and that they had apparently been mistaken for IS group fighters. The Observatory - which relies on a network of sources inside Syria for its information - says it determines what planes carried out raids according to their type location flight patterns and the munitions involved. Asked about the incident the coalition had no immediate comment but said it was looking into the reports. Al-Tukhar lies 14 kilometres (nine miles) north of the town of Manbij a key IS group stronghold that has been repeatedly targeted in raids by the US-led coalition. On Monday the Observatory said 21 civilians had been killed in coalition raids in the area 15 in a northern district of Manbij and another six in Al-Tukhar. Manbij sits on ISs main supply route between Syria and neighbouring Turkey and has been the target of a US-backed offensive by a Kurdish-Arab alliance of fighters since May 31. In June the Syrian Democratic Forces alliance broke into western districts of the town but their advance has been slowed in the past month because of landmines planted by the jihadists and ongoing suicide attacks. Near Aleppo government forces sought to tighten their siege of rebel-held districts of the battleground second city. Clashes erupted around Handarat a largely deserted Palestinian refugee camp north of the city after government forces seized parts of the only remaining supply route into rebel-held eastern districts effectively severing them from the outside world. The capture of the Castello Road has raised fears of a lengthy siege of east Aleppo where residents have already reported food shortages and rising prices. The Observatory said fierce clashes were underway around Handarat Camp which is less than two kilometres (barely a mile) from the northern outskirts of the city. \"If the regime takes Handarat it will be able to completely asphyxiate the rebels in east Aleppo and they will be unable to launch counter-attacks to retake the Castello Road\" Abdel Rahman told AFP. Analysts have warned that the government advances around Aleppo could be \"devastating\" for the rebels. And the United Nations has raised concern about the fate of the more then 200000 people still living in rebel-held districts. It said relief supplies had already been stockpiled in the city but \"further life-saving aid is needed urgently.\"\n",

      "Original article:  Syria regime raids on Aleppo kill 16 civilians Monitor AFP Sunday 5 Jun 2016 Dozens of Syrian regime strikes on Aleppo killed at least 16 civilians on Sunday a monitor said and caused huge damage to one rebel-held district targeted by a barrel bomb. The crude unguided explosive device hit the Qaterji neighbourhood where an AFP photographer saw a street strewn with rubble as residents ran for safety and a rescuer rushed a bloodied child into an ambulance. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said nine civilians were killed in Qaterji and two others including a child were killed in the Mayssar neighbourhood of the northern city. Another five civilians were killed in two other districts and on the citys outskirts. In Qaterji a man stood in the middle of a road surrounded by debris and shouting angrily \"There are only civilians here there are no rebels!\" Further down the street two women and two children scrambled for safety past the mangled iron shutters of shops and buildings badly damaged by the barrel bomb the AFP photographer said. The rescuer his hair covered in white dust carried a child with a blood-covered face to an ambulance in which another wounded child already lay. A truce agreed by Russia and the United States in February has been violated nearly continuously around Aleppo where the regime and rebel groups have fought for control since 2012. Around 200000 people lived in eastern parts of Aleppo held by the rebels and the only route out of those areas has been cut following fierce fighting that erupted on Thursday. More than 300 civilians have been killed in Aleppo since April as rebels have pounded government-controlled neighbourhoods with rocket and artillery fire and the regime has hit rebel areas with air raids. At least 280000 people have been killed and millions displaced since Syrias war started in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests.\n",

Syrias President Bashar al-Assad comes from the Alawite community a religious minority that stems from Shiite Islam. Syrias state news agency SANA reported a \"terrorist attack\" on the main street of the district \"which caused deaths injuries and damage.\" The neighbourhood in the east of Homs is under government control. Homs once dubbed the \"capital\" of Syrias revolution for its prominent well-attended anti-government protests has been the scene of fierce fighting between the regime and rebels. Part of its Old City under rebel control has been subjected to a tight government siege that has left several thousand civilians trapped. In recent weeks UN and Red Crescent teams were able to evacuate some civilians and distribute food and medicine to those remaining in the besieged neighbourhoods but the operations have halted.\n",

Tags Syria Raqqa Russia ISIS IS ISIL Islamic State Daesh The Islamic State launched a counteroffensive in Syrias Raqqa province on Monday killing 40 government forces and expelling many others a monitoring group said. Militants retaliated to a government offensive that began on June 3 with the aim of recapturing the de-facto IS capital Raqqa as well as the countrys largest dam in Tabqa the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. \"Daesh has managed to drive out regime troops from the administrative borders of Raqqa province after a fierce counteroffensive\" the London based monitor said using an Arabic acronym for IS. Hundreds of reinforcements were sent to battle regime forces resulting in the deaths of dozens of soldiers. \"More than 40 members of the pro-regime forces were killed\" said the Observatory which relies on a vast network of sources on the ground for its information. Earlier on Monday pro-regime fighters backed by Russia air power surged towards Tabqa and an adjacent air base held by the Islamic State [IS] group. \"There are fierce clashes now and at least nine pro-government fighters were killed\" said the Observatorys Rami Abdel Rahman. Government fighters have been stuck at about 15 kilometres [10 miles] from the airport for more than a week. The government assault was accompanied by a heavy aerial campaign on the town which allowed them to make advances on Sunday.

      "Original article:  Published September 21 2016 Five medics were killed and a nurse critically wounded when an air strike hit a clinic in a village near Syrias second city Aleppo late Tuesday the aid group that supports it said. The four staff of the Union of Syrian Medical Relief Organisations (UOSSM) were in two ambulances that had been called to the clinic to take some patients for more specialised treatment the group said. The clinic in the village of Khan Tuman was completely levelled in the 1100 pm (2000 GMT) strike and more dead were feared to be buried under the rubble the group added. \"The building has three floors including a basement. Because of the intensity of the bombardment the three storeys collapsed and are completely destroyed\" the groups hospitals and trauma director for the area Ahmed Dbais said in a statement. \"We dont yet know exactly how many dead there are.\" The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said that nine members of the Army of Conquest rebel alliance who were working in the clinic were also killed. The alliance groups rebels with former Al-Qaeda affiliate the Fateh al-Sham Front and Moscow has repeatedly demanded that it be disbanded to allow intensified air strikes against the terrorist faction. Khan Tuman is near Orum al-Kubrah the town where an attack on aid trucks and a warehouse killed around 20 civilians on Monday triggering a war of words between major powers after Washington accused Moscow of responsibility. According to the World Heath Organization Syria is the most dangerous country in the world for health professionals with 135 strikes on clinics and hospitals last year. The head of UOSSM France Dr Ziad Alissa condemned the \"unacceptable\" attack on the groups clinic and staff. \"Deliberately targeting humanitarian workers and medical professionals is a clear violation of international humanitarian law\" he said. \"We appeal to the international community to act swiftly to put a stop to these atrocities. Too many lives have been lost.\" The UOSSM is a medical aid group originally founded by Syrian expatriates but now international.\n",

      "Original article:  Sun Apr 16 2017 Death toll in bomb attack on Syria evacuees rises to 112. Many residents of Fuaa and Kafraya lost their lives after terrorists attacked their buses. Afp - The death toll in a suicide car bomb attack on buses carrying Syrians evacuated from two besieged government-held towns has risen to at least 112 a monitoring group said Sunday. The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that 98 evacuees from the northern towns of Fuaa and Kafraya were killed when an explosives-laden vehicle hit their buses at a transit point west of Aleppo on Saturday. It said the remainder of the dead were aid workers and rebels tasked with guarding the buses. It warned the death toll may rise further as \"hundreds\" more were wounded in the blast. Dozens of buses carrying several thousand refugees had been stuck by the roadside in the rebel-held town of Rashidin after leaving Fuaa and Kafraya on Friday under a deal reached between the government and opposition groups. More than 30000 people are set for evacuation under the deal brokered by rebel backer Qatar and regime ally Iran. Fuaa and Kafraya have been under rebel siege for more than two years. As part of the deal several hundred people including armed rebels will be transported out of Madaya and Zabadani towns near Damascus which are surrounded by pro-government forces. Syrias six-year civil war has seen several similar deals which the government of President Bashar al-Assad says are the best way to end the violence. Rebels say they are being forced to relocate through bombardment and seige. The government blamed Saturdays attack on \"terrorists.\" The blast puts the four-town evacuation deal brokered partly by rebel backer Qatar and government ally Iran in doubt. The Observatory said after the bombing that the evacuation process had resumed but it was not immediately clear on Sunday if convoys had restarted their journeys.\n",

      "Original article:  Wednesday 30 November 2016 Coalition Letter to UN & UNSC Presses for Stopping Assads & Russias Onslaught on Aleppo. The Syrian Coalition called upon the United Nations as the main international sponsor of the political process in Syria to take immediate and decisive action to ensure the protection of the civilians in Aleppo. Action must be taken to stop the barbaric attack on the civilians in Aleppo by compelling the Assad regime to abide by the terms of a cessation of hostilities; allowing unfettered and immediate humanitarian access and medical aid to the city; holding into account those responsible for these crimes; and preventing the repetition of such gross violations.In a letter sent by President of the Syrian Coalition Anas Abdah to the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and President of the UN Security Council Fode Seck the Coalition underscored the desperate humanitarian situation in Aleppo as the regime and its allies continue their relentless indiscriminate bombardment of Aleppo and its countryside.Every hospital in Aleppo has gone out of service leaving hundreds of people injured by the indiscriminate bombardment at the risk of losing their lives for complete lack of medical care the letter said.Abdah noted that the Assad regime and his allies are turning the liberated areas of the city of Aleppo into a real coffin given that official food stocks run out and civilians are under siege.This outrageous escalation in Aleppo has killed more than 670 40% of them are children caused the displacement of more than 3000 families destroyed 11 hospitals and medical centers and known the use of the chlorine gas four times which constitutes a further crime against humanity and a war crime in the regimes long bloody record of barbarity.The letter added: On the other hand it runs in the face of all the international relations including UNSCR 2118 (2013) and 2235 (2015) concerned with the use of indiscriminate weapons in Syria and UNSCR 2254 (2015) and 2268 (2016) endorsing the cessation of hostilities and humanitarian access agreement.The letter also stressed that the Assad regime can only persist in this criminality as long as it enjoys the impunity it has enjoyed so far by the international inaction let alone the active support of its allies particularly Russia.As a pioneer of the human rights and the international peace and security in the world the United Nations has the responsibility to translate words into action to protect the civilians in Aleppo and to make sure that the regimes criminality against its own people no longer goes without consequences.

      "Original article:  31 Oct 2017 At least seven Syrian children were killed in regime shelling of a rebel-held area outside Damascus on Tuesday most as they left school activists said. The Syrian regime has intensified its campaign against the last rebel holdouts on the outskirts of the capital as Russian-sponsored talks in Kazakhstan aim to consolidate de-escalation zones in different parts of the country. The limited local truces are aimed at freezing the lines of the six-year-old civil war which has claimed an estimated 400000 lives and allowing humanitarian aid to flow into besieged areas. The Ghouta Media Center and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least five children were killed when a shell landed at the gate of a school in Jisreen a town in the eastern Ghouta suburbs of Damascus as children were leaving for the day. The Observatory said the death toll is likely to rise and that another child was killed in the village from another shell. One of the children had his legs blown off. Shelling in the northeastern town of Musraba has meanwhile killed another three people including a child according to the Observatory. The Ghouta Media Center said four were killed including two children. Another shell in Harasta also in the eastern Ghouta suburbs landed near a school but only caused injuries. Eastern Ghouta which is still home to an estimated 350000 people has endured years of siege and shelling which has continued despite a de-escalation agreement backed by the regime and its close allies Russia and Iran. On Monday the United Nations said it reached thousands of residents for the first time in over a month. The area is one of the last remaining pockets of opposition to regime leader Assad and depends on aid and smuggling. Rebels have responded to the shelling with a barrage of mortars lobbed at regime-held districts in Damascus wounding at least 10 civilians in three neighbourhoods. The rebels and the regime are meanwhile set to conclude the latest round of talks in the Kazakh capital Astana. The negotiations are sponsored by Turkey which backs the rebels as well as Russia and Iran. The de-escalation zones agreed to in Astana have significantly reduced the violence in many parts of Syria but a lasting political solution remains elusive.

      "Original article:  Last updated at Jul 262016 BEIRUT Syrian government forces on Tuesday seized a rebel-held neighbourhood in the northwest edge of Aleppo tightening their siege of opposition-controlled parts of the city a monitor said. The government also carried out renewed barrel bomb attacks on opposition-held districts a day after bombardments killed at least 24 people the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based monitor said regime troops had full control of the Leramun district after heavy clashes. It also reported intense fighting for neighbouring rebel-held district of Bani Zeid. The two areas have been used by rebels to launch rockets into government-held districts in the citys west. Aleppo has been roughly divided between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012. In recent weeks regime advances have severed the only remaining route into the rebel-held eastern neighbourhoods effectively placing them under siege. Opposition forces have responded by firing missiles into government districts killing scores of civilians. \"The importance of capturing Leramun and Bani Zeid is to stop the missile fire and also to further tighten the siege\" said observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman. He said government forces had now surrounded Bani Zeid reporting heavy air strikes in the area and clashes. The monitor had no immediate toll in the fighting. Government forces effectively severed the oppositions main supply route on July 7 when they advanced to within firing range of the Castello Road. They have since tightened the encirclement of the rebel-held east taking parts of the road itself and causing food shortages and spiralling prices in opposition neighbourhoods. Syrias Al Watan daily which is close to the government also reported advances in Leramun an industrial area that once housed scores of factories. State news agency SANA broadcast a call from the military urging residents of eastern Aleppo to \"join the national reconciliation and expel the foreign mercenaries\" from their neighbourhoods. It said the army had sent text messages to residents and fighters in the east urging rebels to lay down their weapons and identifying safe passages for civilians wishing to leave. Government forces continued to pound opposition areas on Tuesday with the observatory reporting a new barrel bomb attack on the district of Al Mashhad. It said five civilians including three children were killed. On Monday at least 24 people including five children and two women were killed in a barrel bomb attack on the same neighbourhood according to a new toll from the observatory. A statement from the UN childrens agency UNICEF on Tuesday condemned weekend air raids on four hospitals in Aleppo calling them a blatant violation of international humanitarian law that may amount to war crimes. On the humanitarian front a 48-truck aid convoy on Tuesday entered regime-besieged Talbiseh in Homs province with food and other supplies for 40000 people the International Committee of the Red Cross said. More than 280000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests that were met with a regime crackdown.\n",

      "Original article:  Saturday 23 April 2016 18:20 Abdah: Assads Bombing of Aleppo Encouraged by International Communitys Bias. President of the Syrian Coalition Anas al-Abdah said that the international communitys soft stance in dealing with Assad who continues to commit massacres against civilians in Syria is seen by him as a license to carry on with his crimes against the Syrian people. Abdah also said that this complete inaction towards Assads atrocities represents a bias in favor of a serial killer and a war criminal. At least 13 civilians mostly women and children were killed and over 30 others were wounded on Saturday when regime forces bombed a popular market in the District of Douma in Rural Damascus with heavy artillery. The Assad regimes air force continues to relentlessly hit residential areas in the Aleppo neighborhoods of Tariq al-Bab Bustan al-Qasr Salahaddin al-Mashhad al-Amiriyah Baidin al-Jandoul and Bani Zeid. No figure of the casualties resulted has been released by civil defense teams as they are still recovering victims from under the rubble. Activists said that at least 20 civilians including children were killed and many more wounded in intensifying aerial bombing of Aleppo on Friday by regime and Russian forces.

      "Original article:  10 dead after strikes on rebel-held hospitals in Syria Air strikes on two hospitals in rebel-held northwestern Syria on Thursday left 10 people dead including two babies in incubators a monitor said. They were among 19 people killed as a result of strikes across rebel-held Idlib province on Thursday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. An AFP correspondent in the village of Deir Sharqi where one of the hospitals was hit saw extensive damage and wards buried in rubble. It was the third time in less than a week that medical facilities in the province controlled by rebels and Islamist militant groups had been hit in air strikes. \"Apparently Russian aircraft... carried out four successive raids at dawn on a hospital on the outskirts\" of Deir Sharqi it said. \"Six civilians in the emergency department were killed including two babies in incubators after the destruction of the facilitys oxygen generator\" which was keeping them alive Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP. The AFP correspondent saw at least one destroyed incubator rooms and corridors filled with rubble and dusty or damaged beds and equipment. In one room a wall had collapsed on a medicine shelf and in another medical supplies were strewn across the room. Later in the day four medical staff from a dispensary in Maarzita in southern Idlib province were also killed in what were likely Russian strikes the Observatory said. A further nine people including five children were killed in strikes on various other areas of Idlib province on Thursday it said. On Saturday an air raid on another hospital in Idlib had wounded five people the Observatory said but it could not say whether the raid was Syrian or Russian. Another hospital was hit Tuesday in northwestern Idlib putting it out of service Abdel Rahman said. The Britain-based Observatory relies on a network of sources inside Syria and says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used. Idlib is regularly bombed by the air forces of Syria and its Russian ally. More than 320000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests.\n",

      "Original article:  Date of publication 20 September 2016 Syrian regime forces backed by Russian air support repel a rebel offensive on the northern fringes of Syrias Aleppo on Tuesday killing 40 attackers Russias defence ministry said. Tags Syria Aleppo airstrike truce Russia rebels Handarat Mogambo aid convoy Syrian regime and Russian airstrikes pounded multiple battlefronts in Syria into the early hours of Tuesday repelling a rebel-led offensive on northern Aleppo Russian sources reported. At least 40 people were killed in the strikes RIA news agency quoted Russias Defence Ministry as saying. Air raids and artillery fire hit rebel-held districts until approximately 200 am [2300 GMT Monday] after the Syrian army declared a fraught week-long ceasefire over. Fire resumed in the early hours of Tuesday as loud booms were heard intermittently across the city. At least 39 civilians were killed in overnight bombardment of Aleppo and the surrounding province the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said and fresh clashes had erupted on the southern edges of the city. Those killed overnight included 12 people mostly humanitarian workers who died on a raid on a joint United Nations Red Cross and Red Crescent convoy delivering assistance to the town of Orum al-Kubra in Aleppo province In the government-held west of the city an AFP correspondent reported the sound of shelling in the Mogambo district. Meanwhile the rebel-held Handarat district just a few miles north of Aleppo also came under fire The New Arab correspondent reported. Residents spent the night huddled together in their apartments sharing news about the collapsing truce by messenger. Aleppo like other major front lines in Syria had been relatively calm for the first few days after the truce brokered by Moscow and Washington came into effect on September 12. Violence slowly escalated late last week culminating at the weekend in deadly airstrikes on Aleppo and a US-led raid that killed scores of Syrian soldiers fighting the Islamic State group in the east. Fighting also intensified in the rebel-held eastern suburbs of Damascus where the army announced a major military operation on Monday just hours before declaring the ceasefire over. Artillery fire also hit the rebel-held central town of Talbisseh activist Hassaan Abu Nuh said. In the northwestern province of Idlib activist Nayef Mustafa said that planes had circled over the town of Salqin which is held by Syrias former al-Qaeda affiliate in alliance with Islamist rebels. \"Its calm now but there was machinegun fire by military aircraft overnight\" Mustafa told AFP. \"The ceasefire has collapsed and people are getting ready to be hit by barrel bombs. This is our situation.\" The US-Russia truce deal had been billed as the best chance to put an end to more than five years of conflict in which more than 300000 people have been killed. The army declared an end to its ceasefire on Monday evening. Hours later a convoy delivering aid to besieged civilians in Aleppo province was hit by an airstrike which killed 12 Red Crescent volunteers and drivers and destroyed at least 18 trucks.

      "Original article:  9 dead as new Islamist alliance attacks Syrias Aleppo Monitor AFP Thursday 2 Jul 2015 At least nine people were killed and dozens wounded on Thursday as a new Islamist opposition alliance including Al-Qaedas Syrian affiliate attacked government-held parts of Aleppo city a monitor said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said four civilians had been killed and more than 70 wounded in a massive multi-district assault by the rebel coalition. Another five rebel fighters were killed in the clashes that erupted with government forces in western Aleppo. Rebels fired several hundred rockets and projectiles into at least seven government-held neighbourhoods with the army returning fire and regime aircraft carrying out raids Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. He described the clashes as some of the fiercest yet in the government-held parts of the city particularly in the district of Zahra already partly under opposition control and home to an air force intelligence base. The new alliance calling itself Ansar Sharia including various Islamist factions and the jihadist Al-Nusra Front Al-Qaedas affiliate in Syria. Online a statement announcing the grouping pledged \"victory for the Muslims of Aleppo\". Control of Aleppo once Syrias economic powerhouse has been divided between government and rebel forces since shortly after fighting began there in mid-2012. The regime largely controls the west of the city with rebels from different factions present in the east. The situation is largely reversed in the countryside surrounding the city and both government and rebel forces have at times sought to encircle their opponents and besiege them. In recent months Al-Nusra has allied elsewhere with Islamist rebels to win large swathes of territory from the regime particularly in northwestern Idlib. Most of that province is now under rebel control after a grouping named the Army of Conquest which includes Al-Nusra and its allies seized the provincial capital and most remaining government strongholds. More than 230000 people have been killed in Syria since the countrys conflict began in March 2011.\n",

      "Original article:  Last updated at Apr 152017 A suicide car bomb attack on buses carrying Syrians evacuated from two besieged government-held towns killed 43 people on Saturday as US-backed fighters advanced in their push towards the Daesh terror groups Raqqa stronghold. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the blast targeted buses carrying residents evacuated from the northern towns of Fuaa and Kafraya under a deal reached between the regime and rebels. Bodies were still being recovered from the attack at a transit point in Rashidin west of Aleppo according to the observatory. \"The suicide bomber was driving a van supposedly carrying aid supplies and detonated near the buses\" the monitoring group said. It said that most of the dead were evacuees but also included several rebels who had been guarding the buses. Thousands of evacuees had been stuck on the road because of a disagreement over the number of rebels allowed to leave two other towns included in the deal but the process restarted following the blast the observatory said. AFPs reporter in rebel-held Rashidin saw several bodies body parts and blood scattered on the ground. The bombing took place as thousands of evacuees from Fuaa and Kafraya waited to continue their journey to regime-controlled Aleppo the coastal province of Latakia or Damascus. More than 5000 people who had lived under crippling siege for more than two years left the two towns along with 2200 evacuated from rebel-held Madaya and Zabadani on Friday. Syrias war has left more than 320000 people dead since erupting in 2011 with more than half the population forced from their homes and hundreds of thousands enduring siege-like conditions. It has sucked in regional and international powers and allowed extremist groups to seize vast areas of the country. US-backed fighters reached the outskirts of a key extremist-held town in northern Syria on Saturday as part of an offensive aimed at the Daesh bastion of Raqqa. SDF advances The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) an Arab-Kurdish alliance supported by US-led coalition air strikes and special forces advisers surrounded Tabaqa in early April and have cut its main supply routes. The town and a vast nearby dam are considered key prizes in the broader offensive for Raqqa the de facto Syrian capital of Daeshs self-proclaimed caliphate about 55 kilometres to the east. An SDF military source said Saturday that clashes were fierce and that the alliances forces were trying to penetrate the town from the east and west. The alliance was reported to have advanced overnight after driving the extremists from two areas just southeast and southwest of the town. SDF fighters are within a few hundred metres of Tabaqa said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. He said heavy clashes were under way around the two suburbs as Daesh attempted to counter-attack. The SDF launched its campaign for Raqqa in November and has since captured most of the surrounding province. It has been backed by US-led coalition air strikes along with advisers and even an American Marines artillery battery. Raqqa was home to around 240000 residents before 2011 and more than 80000 people have fled to the city from other parts of the country since the start of Syrias civil war. Tabaqa sits on a key supply route into Raqqa and served as an important Daesh command base housing the groups main prison. Backed by Russia and local militias pro-government forces have made a string of recent gains. The government and rebels have brokered a series of deals to evacuate people from besieged areas which Damascus touts as the best way to end the violence. Rebels say they are forced out by siege and bombardment. The deal involving the evacuees targeted on Saturday has been beset by delays and the 5000 Fuaa and Kafraya residents had waited in Rashidin for more than a day without moving before the bomb went off an AFP correspondent said. Around 2220 evacuees from Madaya and Zabadani were similarly blocked at a transit point in government-held territory one of them told AFP by telephone. State television said the car bombing had been carried out by terrorist groups a term the regime applies to all armed opposition groups. Many residents had earlier expressed regret over not knowing when if ever they would be able to return to their homes. Its terrible to be uprooted like this to go and live in a place that is not ours said Jama Nayef a vet from Fuaa.\n",

Ibrahim al-Hajj a volunteer with the group said residents of the opposition-held side which is under siege could not flee and people were largely cowering inside their homes. \"Nothing about what the regime said about corridors is real nothing. How can we move on the streets if we dont feel safe. If it was real I would leave now\" says Mustafa a 48-year-old man who lives with his two elderly parents his wife and daughter. \"They want only a humanitarian corridor to get out of Aleppo they do not want anything else. They want a road to leave Aleppo\" says al-Hajj. \"People are waiting on Gods mercy.

Another showed rescuers digging out a toddler with their bare hands shouting \"God is Great\" as they lifted him from the debris. The boy showed no signs of life as he was rushed off in a rescuers arms. The airstrikes include the use of incendiary bombs and cluster munitions according to residents who blame forces loyal to the Assad regime and the Russians for the aerial attacks. \"We feel the earth trembling and shaking under our feet. Aleppo is burning\" activist Bahaa al Halabi told dpa from the besieged opposition-held districts. \"People are not safe anymore even in shelters\" resident Yassin Abu Raed said. Other residents also said the latest raids were destroying underground shelters people had built. Water stations have been badly damaged and humanitarian aid has not reached the opposition-held district in many weeks. One resident said people were eating mostly rice and lentils which had been stockpiled noting that there were few vegetables left. \"I am now going to eat my last potato\" Rami an Aleppo resident said.\n",

In a relevant development in Syria the army thwarted a series of attacks by the Takfiri terrorists on a strategic region in Aleppo province Northern Syria. The Takfiri terrorists were trying to attack a strategic region of Jamiat al-Zahra in Western Aleppo but they failed. Aleppo has been the scene of heavy clashes between the terrorists and the Syrian troops in the last several weeks.

The army units took control of al-Karima town before starting their advances towards Sahl al-Qab region in Western Hama. Al-Karima town is of strategic importance because it links the three provinces of Homs Idlib and Lattakia. The victory in Karima paves the way for the Syrian army to move towards Shal al-Qab region.

      "Original article:  Published April 5 2017 The jet fighters from the Syrian regime have attacked settlements in the Syrian province of Idlib with chemical weapons killing at least 70 people including dozens of women and children and displaying once again the barbarity of the Bashar Assad administration. All this is happening as the so-called cease-fire is in effect in the region and the Russians are \"monitoring\" it. Idlib was the target of the regime because opposition groups and those sympathizing with them have moved out of Aleppo through an agreement brokered by Turkey and Russia. The cease-fire was supposed to have secured protection for the people of Idlib but that has been proven wrong as the regime jet fighters attacked the city with chemical bombs. Local sources reported that Syrian helicopters also attacked several settlements in the area with barrel bombs containing chemical weapons. Doctors in the town of Khan Skeikhoun in the Idlib province held by the opposition said victims started to choke vomit and faint with foam coming out of their mouths. The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said women and children were among the dozens killed with reports of \"suffocation\" by barrel bombs. The Assad regime is back to using chemical weapons. So what will the international community do in view of this monstrous atrocity? The Assad regime has done this before and after the international uproar it had \"given up\" its chemical weapons to international observers. We were told Assad did not have chemical weapons. So now that Assad is back to using these weapons it seems the international community intentionally or unintentionally simply turned a blind eye and the Assad regime simply stored the weapons to be used at a future date. The Russian mentors of the terrorist Assad who themselves face terrorist attacks in their own backyard in St. Petersburg have to see that collaborating with terrorists only brings misery and destruction. This time Assad has to be stopped. The chemical weapons Assad uses have to be taken away from him for good and he has to pay for his atrocities. Even the Russians cannot stand behind Assad as he commits these gross violations. The Americans cant simply say they are just interested in fighting Daesh and just turn a blind eye to the dangerous turn of events in Idlib. Tomorrow someone in Syria may decide to use such weapons against the U.S. forces there.Turkey is trying to create its own secure zone that Assad would never dare attack in northern Syria. But the fact that Assad is using his jet fighters and helicopters to attack even the civilians who sympathize with the Syrian opposition shows the urgent need for declaring the safe zones created by Turkey as no-fly zones. This is something that has to be looked into by the international community. The Russians can secure this zone with their air power and their ground to air S-400 missile systems thus at least offering some hope for the Syrian people trying to escape Assads atrocities.\n",

      "Published April 5 2017 The ISIS fighters from Syria have attacked settlements in the Syrian province of Homs with chemical weapons killing at least 70 people including dozens of women and children and displaying once again the barbarity of extremist groups. All this is happening as the so-called cease-fire is in effect in the region and the Russians are \"monitoring\" it. Homs was the target of the ISIS fighters because opposition groups and those sympathizing with them have moved out of Aleppo through an agreement brokered by Turkey and Russia. The cease-fire was supposed to have secured protection for the people of Homs but that has been proven wrong as the ISIS fighters attacked the city with chemical bombs. Local sources reported that Syrian helicopters also attacked several settlements in the area with barrel bombs containing chemical weapons. Doctors in the town of Khan Skeikhoun in the Homs province held by the opposition said victims started to choke vomit and faint with foam coming out of their mouths. The U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said women and children were among the dozens killed with reports of \"suffocation\" by barrel bombs. ISIS fighters are back to using chemical weapons. So what will the international community do in view of this monstrous atrocity?  We were told extremist groups like ISIS did not have chemical weapons. So now that ISIS is back to using these weapons it seems the international community intentionally or unintentionally simply turned a blind eye and the extremist group simply stored the weapons to be used at a future date. The Russian mentors of the terrorist organization who themselves face terrorist attacks in their own backyard in St. Petersburg have nothing to say on this occasion.\n",

      "Original article:  6 Oct 2016 At least 29 people were killed and dozens wounded in a suicide bombing that targeted a Syria-Turkey border crossing on Thursday. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights the casualties included fighters from the Free Syrian Army (FSA) the Turkish-backed force which has played a pivotal role in the fight against DAESH along the Syria-Turkey border. The attack took place on the Syrian side of the Atmeh crossing west of Aleppo during a change of guard among the FSA the Observatory said. According to Anadolu Agency the blast targeted the Atmeh refugee camp. In an online statement DAESH has claimed responsibilty for the attack. Witnesses said most of the fighters killed in the attack were from the Failaq al-Sham. The group has been fighting alongside other Turkish-backed factions in Ankaras offensive dubbed \"Euphrates Shield\" against DAESH. (TRT World and Agencies) The fighters use the Atmeh crossing to move between the Syrian province of Idlib through Turkey to the areas where anti-DAESH operations are taking place the Observatory said. Residents said they also use it to evacuate wounded fighters. Among the dead from the Atmeh blast were the head of the top civil judicial body in rebel-held eastern Aleppo Sheikh Khaled al-Sayyed and a judge who worked with him a witness and a rebel official said. Idlib province where Atmeh is located is a bastion of the opposition groups fighting Bashar al-Assads regime. The multi-sided civil war has raged on for more than five years. Opposition fighters have been targeted at the crossing before. DAESH claimed responsibility for a mid-August suicide attack there that killed at least 32. The fighters killed on Thursday were also among those participating in Euphrates Shield. Ankara began the unprecedented cross-border operation on August 24 saying it was targeting both DAESH and the YPG which Turkey considers a terrorist group. The operation has so far captured the DAESH stronghold of Jarablus and is pushing towards the towns of Dabiq and Al-Bab.

One of the local Emir of the ISIL terrorist group and at least 34 of his comrades were killed in clashes with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in Eastern Aleppo near the Tishrin Dam. The SDF mainly comprising of Kurdish fighters repelled ISILs offensives on their positions near the villages of al-Qaderiyeh Bibkar Kadoushan Ash al-Shami and Western Saikoul killing at least 35 terrorists including Abu Foras al-Safrani the Emir of ISIL in Saikoul region. The SDF fighters also detonated two ISIL bomb-laden vehicles including an armored one. In relevant development in the same region on Sunday the SDF in several hours of non-stop battle pushed the ISIL back from more neighborhoods in the town of Manbij in Northeastern Aleppo and took full control of more key streets and building blocks. The Kurdish-led SDF fighters continued their advances against the ISIL in al-Hazavaneh district in Eastern side of Manbij and captured al-Rabet street FNA reports. ISIS (Daesh) left behind scores of dead and wounded members and pulled the remaining pockets of its forces back from the battlefield. The SDF fighters started demining of the newly-liberated positions local sources said. 12\n",

      "Original article:  Syria bombs jihadist positions in Raqa for second day AFP Monday 18 Aug 2014 Syrian war planes bombed positions belonging to the jihadist Islamic State group in the northern province of Raqa for a second day on Monday a monitoring group said. On Sunday regime planes killed 31 jihadists and eight civilians in an unprecedented wave of aerial bombardment against the group in its Raqa bastion. The bombing continued on Monday according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights with at least 14 raids against jihadist positions. There was no immediate death toll in the renewed bombing. Three raids targeted the area around the town of Tabqa in western Raqa and four hit near the Tabqa military airport the only remaining regime-held position in the province. The other seven strikes hit sites inside Raqa city the provincial capital. The raids involved the use of precision weapons rather than the explosive-packed barrel bombs that the regime has deployed to deadly effect in Aleppo province and elsewhere. Barrel bombs have been criticised for being indiscriminate and killing civilians. The Syrian raids come as the United States carries out air strikes against the Islamic State just across the border in neighbouring Iraq. The US strikes are intended to limit the advance of IS militants who have seized large swathes of territory in both Iraq and Syria declaring an Islamic \"caliphate.\" The group emerged from Al-Qaedas one-time Iraq affiliate but has since broken with that organisation and grown into a cross-border militant group. It has been battling rival opposition fighters in Syria since early January after a backlash because of the groups abuses against civilians and rebels and its bid to dominate captured territory.\n",

      "Original article:  Air strikes kill 11 including children in Syrias Idlib monitor AFP Wednesday 13 Jul 2016 At least 11 civilians including three children were killed in air strikes on a rebel-held town in Syrias northwestern Idlib province on Wednesday a monitor said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said it was unclear if the strikes on the town of Ariha in Idlib province were carried out by Syrian government or Russian war planes. The town is controlled by the Army of Conquest a rebel alliance of mainly Islamist groups including Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front that holds almost all of Idlib province. Video uploaded by activists purportedly showed the aftermath of the strikes with residents and civil defence workers picking though debris looking for survivors. Idlib has regularly been targeted by both Syrian government air strikes and raids carried out by its Russian ally. A longtime backer of the government in Damascus Moscow stepped up its support for President Bashar al-Assad on September 30 when it began an air campaign aimed at bolstering regime positions. Elsewhere in the country the Observatory said at least eight people were killed on Wednesday in the town of Rastan in central Homs province. Five of them died in air strikes on the towns market place which also wounded dozens of people. Another three were killed in shelling earlier Wednesday.\n",

      "Air strikes kill 11 including children in Syria's Idlib monitor AFP Wednesday 13 Jul 2016 At least 11 civilians, including three children, were killed in shelling on a rebel-held town in Syria's northwestern Idlib province on Wednesday, a monitor said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor said it was unclear if the shelling on the town of Ariha in Idlib province was carried out by Syrian government or Russian war planes. Civilians were caught in the middle of the conflict, with residents and civil defence workers picking through debris looking for survivors. Idlib has regularly been targeted by both Syrian government air strikes and raids carried out by its Russian ally. A longtime backer of the government in Damascus, Moscow stepped up its support for President Bashar al-Assad on September 30 when it began an air campaign aimed at bolstering regime positions. Elsewhere in the country, the Observatory said at least eight people were killed on Wednesday in the town of Rastan in central Homs province. Five of them died in shelling on the town's marketplace, which also wounded dozens of people. Another three were killed in shelling earlier Wednesday.\n",

Twenty-six civilians were also killed yesterday when Assads air force pounded the neighborhood of Al-Maghayer in Aleppo killing 26 civilians mostly children and women.

Despite all the odds the Syrian people will not hesitate to uphold the rights to freedom justice and dignity. The Syrians belief their goals will grow even stronger inspired by the determination of those who sacrificed their lives to continue the revolution until victory is achieved. The Syrian Coalition emphasizes that the Assad regimes continued atrocities lay responsibility on the international community to protect Syrian civilians through the imposition of a safe areas to rein in Assads air force. All kinds of legal recognition of the Assad regime must be withdrawn as it would not have committed all these atrocities had it not been for its confidence of the inaction of the international community.

Moscow warns against new US missile strikes on Syria chief of the Russian General Staffs Main Operational Directorate Col. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi said at a news briefing on Tuesday. Militants are delivering toxic chemicals in Khan Shaikhoun the Jira airport East Ghouta and to the West of Aleppo the Russian General Staff said. The aim of these actions is to forge another pretext for accusing the Syrian government of using chemical weapons and for triggering new US strikes. We warn against such inadmissible steps the general staff said. The general reiterated that the Syrian army does not possess chemical weapons while the remaining two chemical weapons production and storage facilities in Syria are located on the territory controlled by the so-called armed opposition groups. We demand a thorough investigation of the alleged chemical attack by Syrian aviation on the city of Khan-Shaikhoun Rudskoi said. On April 4 a chemical weapons incident in Syrias Idlib province claimed the lives of some 80 people and inflicted harm on an additional 200 civilians. The Syrian National Coalition of Revolutionary and Opposition Forces as well as a number of Western states accused the Syrian government troops of carrying out the attack while Damascus refuted these allegations with a Syrian army source telling Sputnik that the army did not possess chemical weapons.\n",

      "Original article:  30 October 2016 Three killed over 70 injured in terrorist attacks including with chemical weapons in Aleppo. Terrorist organizations affiliated to Turkish and Saudi regimes targeted on Sunday al-Hamadaniyeh area and al-Assad residential suburb in Aleppo city with shells that contained toxic gases. According to SANA reporter more than 35 people suffered suffocation due to the attack which was launched by the terrorist organizations positioned on the western outskirts of Aleppo city. Upon visiting the injured in al-Jamiaa (University) and al-Razi hospitals the reporter said the injured are suffering from vomiting shortness of breath mydriasis numbness in the limbs and muscle spasms adding that the medical cadres are taking all measures to prevent the health condition of the injured from getting worse. In 2013 the terrorist organizations launched toxic gas attacks on a number of residential areas in the Eastern Ghouta of Damascus al-Sukkari neighborhood in Aleppo city and a number of villages and towns in the northern countryside of Aleppo. According to reports members in the Turkish Parliament revealed on various occasions that the Turkish regime under Recep Tayyip Erdogan has provided the terrorist organizations in Syria with toxic gases and is protecting those who are involved in producing chemical weapons of sarin and other toxic gases. Two killed 6 injured in terrorist rocket attacks in Aleppo Earlier two persons including a child were killed and 6 others were injured in terrorist rocket shells attack on al-Hamadaniyeh and al-Meridian neighborhoods in Aleppo according to SANA reporter in Aleppo. The reporter quoted a source at Aleppo Police Command as saying that the terrorist organizations positioned in the eastern neighborhoods of the city and some terrorist hotbeds in the western side of it targeted with rocket shells al-Hamadaniyeh and al-Meridian neighborhoods in Aleppo killing two people including a child and injuring 6 others. The source added that the terrorist attacks caused material damage to the citizens houses and properties. A woman killed 30 injured in ISIS attacks in Deir Ezzor In the same context a woman was killed and 30 other people were injured due to ISIS shelling attack on al-Joura and al-Qusour neighborhoods in Deir Ezzor city.

      "Original article:  August 1 2011 Factbox: Syrias city of Hama site of new assault. Syrian tanks shelled the central city of Hama Monday killing four civilians residents said a day after rights groups said security forces killed 80 there in one of the bloodiest days of the five-month-old uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. Here are some details about the city which was the site of a massacre in 1982: * 1982: - In the late 1970s and early 1980s Syrias Muslim Brotherhood sought to destabilize and unseat President Hafez al-Assad and his government through political assassinations and urban guerilla warfare. In February 1982 the Muslim Brotherhood ambushed government forces searching for dissidents in Hama. - Syrian government forces attacked the city razing the old quarters of Hama to crush the armed uprising by Brotherhood fighters who had taken refuge there. - Estimates of the death toll in the three weeks of operations in Hama vary from 10000 to more than 30000 out of a population of 350000. Syria then imprisoned much of the membership of the local Islamist group. - Syrian human rights groups said that women children and the elderly were among those killed in the crackdown and thousands were forced to flee the city. * 2011: - In June activists said Syrian forces killed at least 60 protesters in the city. Residents said security forces and snipers had fired on crowds of demonstrators. - Assad sacked the governor of Hama province on July 2 a day after tens of thousands of protesters massed in the provincial capital to demand the Syrian leader step down. - The demonstration in Hama was part of nationwide protests which activists said were some of the biggest since the uprising against Assads rule erupted in mid-March. - In a symbolic show of solidarity U.S. ambassador Robert Ford and French ambassador Eric Chevallier visited Hama on July 8 to put pressure on Assad not to crush the protest. Syria condemned the action and summoned them to Damascus on July 10. - Ford had only arrived in Damascus in January. After he posted a letter on the embassys Facebook page a mob stormed the embassy compound July 11 tearing down plaques. - On July 31 a tank-backed assault killed at least 80 people in Hama rights groups said. The state news agency said the military was purging armed groups that were terrorizing citizens. Monday tanks shelled a northeastern district of Hama killing four more civilians two residents said. * ABOUT HAMA: - Hama has been settled as far back as the Bronze Age and Iron Age. Famous for its citadel and its ancient Norias (waterwheels) the younger Assad and his government has sought to promote the city as a tourist destination. - Hama Syrias fourth biggest city has a mostly Sunni Muslim population of 700000. It lies about 210 km (131 miles) north of Damascus.

Hara is less than two kilometres (one mile) from a strategic hill in Daraa province that Al-Nusra Front jihadist rebels seized on October 5 in a battle that cost the lives of 30 regime forces and 29 insurgents. Meanwhile in northeastern Idlib province the Observatory said three children were killed and another five injured in air strikes on Tel Minis in the south. More than 180000 people have been killed in Syria since an uprising against President Bashar al-Assads regime began in 2011 escalating into a multi-sided civil war that has drawn thousands of jihadists from overseas.\n",

      "Original article:  Published July 19 2016 A Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) fighter walks in the silos and mills of Manbij after the SDF took control of it in Aleppo Governorate Syria July 1 2016. (Reuters Photo) Airstrikes on Daesh-held villages in northern Syria killed at least 85 civilians on Tuesday as intense fighting was underway between the militants and U.S-backed fighters Syrian opposition activists and the extremist group said. Residents in the area blamed the U.S.-led coalition for the strikes that targeted two villages Tokhar and Hoshariyeh which are controlled by IS activists said. The villages are near the Daesh stronghold of Manbij a town that members of the PYD-dominated U.S.-backed Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) have been trying to capture in a weeks-long offensive. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 56 civilians including 11 children were killed in the strikes on the villages which also wounded dozens. Another activist group the Local Coordination Committees said dozens of civilians mostly families were killed. Turkeys official Anadolu Agency put the death toll at least at 85 adding that 50 civilians were also wounded in airstrikes. The Daesh-linked Aamaq news agency claimed 160 civilians mostly women and children were killed in Tokhar alone in a series of purportedly American airstrikes around dawn Tuesday. Postings on a Facebook page show images of people including children as they were being put in collective grave purportedly in the village of Tokhar. One photograph shows a man carrying the lifeless body of a child covered with dust while another shows a child partly covered by a blanket lying in a grave. Tuesdays casualties come on the heels of similar airstrikes on the Daesh-held town of Manbij on Monday when at least 15 civilians were reportedly killed. Meanwhile the headquarters of Daesh militants inside Manbij was captured as SDF forces pushed into the western part of the town over the weekend the U.S. military said in a statement on Tuesday. The headquarters which was located in a hospital was being used as a command center and logistics hub. The U.S.-backed Syrian rebels also took control of part of the town enabling civilians in the area to flee the fighting the statement said. The rebels were continuing to battle Daesh on four fronts for control of Manbij clearing territory as they pushed toward the center of the city the statement said. Daesh militants have staged counterattacks but the Syrian rebels have maintained momentum with the help of air strikes by the U.S.-led coalition the statement said. It said the coalition has carried out more than 450 air strikes around Manbij since the operation to take the town began. The U.S. Central Command said the coalition conducted 18 strikes on Monday and destroyed 13 Daesh fighting positions seven Daesh vehicles and two car bombs near Manbij. The Manbij area has seen intense battles between Daesh extremists and the Kurdish-led fighters who have been advancing under the cover of intense airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition. If Manbij is captured by the U.S.-backed fighters it will be the biggest strategic defeat for Daesh in Syria since July 2015 when the extremist group lost the border town of Tal Abyad. In neighboring Iraq meanwhile Daesh has been beaten back on several fronts with Iraqi forces aided by U.S.-led coalition airstrikes having retaken the cities of Ramadi and Fallujah in western Anbar province.\n",

      "Original article:  Date of publication 12 August 2016 Airstrikes in opposition areas of Syrias northern Aleppo province struck a market a hospital and a village on Friday. Tags Aleppo civil defence UN airstrikes Russia Airstrikes in opposition areas of Syrias northern Aleppo province struck a market a hospital and a village on Friday killing at least 18 people including children and two hospital staffers. The air raids hit the only hospital for women and children in the town of Kafr Hamra before dawn killing two staffers including a nurse. The Syrian Civil Defence a group of first responders said it pulled 10 people alive from under the rubble. Kafr Hamra is near the northern front line in the deeply divided city of Aleppo where government troops have sealed the main route into opposition areas effectively trapping nearly 300000 residents. The Syrian Civil Defence said one of its centres in the rebel-held part of Aleppo was hit. Pictures on the groups Facebook page showed serious damage to one of its vehicles and crumbling walls. The volunteer group said one of its most well-known members died after being buried under the rubble following a Wednesday airstrike in the Ramouseh area recently seized by rebels from government forces. Khaled Harah had recovered a live baby from a destroyed building in Aleppos Sukkari neighbourhood in 2014 following a 16-hour rescue effort. \"It was a miracle\" said Bibars Mishal a colleague of Harah in Aleppo. Harah was later invited to the UN Security Council to testify about the violence in Aleppo. Mishal said Harahs body was pulled from the rubble on Thursday.

That road remains under fire and the UN has asked for a cease-fire to allow aid into the area. Health facilities have been frequently targeted in the civil war in Syria. Aid groups have said the month of July was one of the worst since the war began in 2011 with some 43 facilities in opposition areas partially or totally destroyed. Despite calls for a ceasefire and Russias promise of a three-hour daily respite from airstrikes to allow in humanitarian aid there has been no let-up in the violence. During the day Friday airstrikes hit a market in the nearby town of Urem al-Kubra killing at least six people according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which relies on activists on the ground. Urem al-Kubra lies on the road linking Aleppo to the northern rebel-controlled province of Idlib which has also seen intense bombing. In the northern Aleppo countryside at least 10 people were killed including children and women when airstrikes hit the village of Hayan. It was not clear what the target was but videos shared by activists of the scene of the attack show the bodies of women and children strewn on the side of the road as frantic residents scramble to recover them. The Local Coordination Committees an activist collective said outdoor Friday prayers were called off in Idlib because of the intensity of the airstrikes. Germany meanwhile called for UN-supervised humanitarian access to Aleppo saying Russias unilateral three-hour daily cease-fire isnt enough. Russia has been carrying out airstrikes to bolster Syrian government forces since last September. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was quoted as telling Fridays edition of the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that \"humanitarian access cant be under the single-handed control of one side of the conflict.\" \"A unilaterally declared three-hour cease-fire per day isnt enough to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe\" he said.

Thirteen militants of the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Levant organization were killed Monday during battles with other opposition armed groups in Idlib countryside. Thirteen militants of the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Levant organization were killed Monday during battles with other opposition armed groups in Idlib countryside. The opposition UK-based Syrian observatory indicated that among the killed was a local Libyan emir who was killed during violent clashes with gunmen in the vicinity of Hazano town several kilometers away from the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey. Another seven people of a local armed group were also killed in the clash which took place after al-Qaeda terrorist organization members tried to arrest two persons of the town residents. Earlier ISIL gunmen seized the headquarters of al-Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra terrorist group in the Shaddadi area in Hasakah countryside north-east of the country. Moreover in Azaz situation is still unstable after recent clashes between the ISIL militiamen and Storm of North Brigade of the so-called free Syrian army. The free army accused the ISIL of violating the cease-fire agreement by abstaining from releasing many of the detainees. Recently fierce clashes erupted between the ISIL Al-Nusra Front and the free army in the wake of disputes on power and control sharing over areas not reclaimed so far by the Syrian army. The Syrian national military launched a wide-scale military operation in May 2013 in the countrys main provinces to restore security and release citizens from terrorist threats. Syria was hit by a violent unrest since mid-March 2011 where the Syrian government accuses foreign actors of orchestrating the conflict by supporting the militant opposition groups with arms and money. \n",

The opposition UK-based Syrian observatory indicated that among the killed was a local Libyan emir who was killed during violent clashes with gunmen in the vicinity of Hazano town several kilometers away from the Bab al-Hawa border crossing with Turkey. Another seven people of a local armed group were also killed in the clash which took place after al-Qaeda terrorist organization members tried to arrest two persons of the town residents. Earlier ISIL gunmen seized the headquarters of al-Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra terrorist group in the Shaddadi area in Hasakah countryside north-east of the country. Moreover in Azaz situation is still unstable after recent clashes between the ISIL militiamen and Storm of North Brigade of the so-called free Syrian army. The free army accused the ISIL of violating the cease-fire agreement by abstaining from releasing many of the detainees. Recently fierce clashes erupted between the ISIL Al-Nusra Front and the free army in the wake of disputes on power and control sharing over areas not reclaimed so far by the Syrian army. The Syrian national military launched a wide-scale military operation in May 2013 in the countrys main provinces to restore security and release citizens from terrorist threats. Syria was hit by a violent unrest since mid-March 2011 where the Syrian government accuses foreign actors of orchestrating the conflict by supporting the militant opposition groups with arms and money.\n",

      "Original article:  Last updated at Apr 152017 A suicide car bomb attack on buses carrying Syrians evacuated from two besieged government-held towns killed 43 people on Saturday as US-backed fighters advanced in their push towards the Daesh terror groups Raqqa stronghold. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the blast targeted buses carrying residents evacuated from the northern towns of Fuaa and Kafraya under a deal reached between the regime and rebels. Bodies were still being recovered from the attack at a transit point in Rashidin west of Aleppo according to the observatory. \"The suicide bomber was driving a van supposedly carrying aid supplies and detonated near the buses\" the monitoring group said. It said that most of the dead were evacuees but also included several rebels who had been guarding the buses. Thousands of evacuees had been stuck on the road because of a disagreement over the number of rebels allowed to leave two other towns included in the deal but the process restarted following the blast the observatory said. AFPs reporter in rebel-held Rashidin saw several bodies body parts and blood scattered on the ground. The bombing took place as thousands of evacuees from Fuaa and Kafraya waited to continue their journey to regime-controlled Aleppo the coastal province of Latakia or Damascus. More than 5000 people who had lived under crippling siege for more than two years left the two towns along with 2200 evacuated from rebel-held Madaya and Zabadani on Friday. Syrias war has left more than 320000 people dead since erupting in 2011 with more than half the population forced from their homes and hundreds of thousands enduring siege-like conditions. It has sucked in regional and international powers and allowed extremist groups to seize vast areas of the country. US-backed fighters reached the outskirts of a key extremist-held town in northern Syria on Saturday as part of an offensive aimed at the Daesh bastion of Raqqa. SDF advances The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) an Arab-Kurdish alliance supported by US-led coalition air strikes and special forces advisers surrounded Tabaqa in early April and have cut its main supply routes. The town and a vast nearby dam are considered key prizes in the broader offensive for Raqqa the de facto Syrian capital of Daeshs self-proclaimed caliphate about 55 kilometres to the east. An SDF military source said Saturday that clashes were fierce and that the alliances forces were trying to penetrate the town from the east and west. The alliance was reported to have advanced overnight after driving the extremists from two areas just southeast and southwest of the town. SDF fighters are within a few hundred metres of Tabaqa said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. He said heavy clashes were under way around the two suburbs as Daesh attempted to counter-attack. The SDF launched its campaign for Raqqa in November and has since captured most of the surrounding province. It has been backed by US-led coalition air strikes along with advisers and even an American Marines artillery battery. Raqqa was home to around 240000 residents before 2011 and more than 80000 people have fled to the city from other parts of the country since the start of Syrias civil war. Tabaqa sits on a key supply route into Raqqa and served as an important Daesh command base housing the groups main prison. Backed by Russia and local militias pro-government forces have made a string of recent gains. The government and rebels have brokered a series of deals to evacuate people from besieged areas which Damascus touts as the best way to end the violence. Rebels say they are forced out by siege and bombardment. The deal involving the evacuees targeted on Saturday has been beset by delays and the 5000 Fuaa and Kafraya residents had waited in Rashidin for more than a day without moving before the bomb went off an AFP correspondent said. Around 2220 evacuees from Madaya and Zabadani were similarly blocked at a transit point in government-held territory one of them told AFP by telephone. State television said the car bombing had been carried out by terrorist groups a term the regime applies to all armed opposition groups. Many residents had earlier expressed regret over not knowing when if ever they would be able to return to their homes. Its terrible to be uprooted like this to go and live in a place that is not ours said Jama Nayef a vet from Fuaa.\n",

      "Original article:  Date of publication 8 April 2017 An airstrike by Russian warplanes on Saturday killed 18 people including five children and two women in the rebel stronghold of Urom al-Joz in Syrias Idlib province. Tags Syria Idlib airstrike Russian human rights Homs bombing Islamic State At least 18 civilians including five children and two women were killed in an airstrike on Syrias northwestern province of Idlib on Saturday the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. An earlier death toll from the strike on the rebel stronghold of Urum al-Joz reported 15 people were killed but three more died after sustaining serious injuries. The names of all 18 killed were listed by Ariha Today activist group which said the death toll is likely to rise as many of the wounded remain in critical conditions. The Britain-based Observatory said the strike was likely to have been carried out by Russian war jets which operate in support of the Syrian regime. The Observatory which relies on a network of sources inside Syria for its information says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used. Idlib province is controlled by a rebel alliance that includes former al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and is regularly targeted by both the Syrian regime and its Russian ally. Earlier this week a suspected chemical attack hit the town of Khan Sheikhun in Idlib killing at least 87 civilians including 31 children. Much of the international community accused Bashar al-Assads regime of responsibility for that attack though Damascus involved responsibility. The Khan Sheikhun strike prompted Washington to take its first direct military action against Assads regime with missile strikes against a central air base on Friday morning. In return Moscow announced it would ramp up air defences in Syria in an attempt to show a tough line on the US actions. Bus bombing in Homs province Also on Saturday Syrian state TV reported a bomb exploded aboard a bus carrying workers near the central city of Homs killing a woman and wounding 25. It gave no further details about the explosion but the governor of Homs province Talal Barrazi told AP the bomb was placed inside a bus that transports workers at a private factory. The Observatory confirmed a woman was killed in the blast saying it also wounded more than 20 people. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack but Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and the Islamic State group have carried out similar attacks in the past. More than 320000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government demonstrations. Read Also\n",

An earlier death toll from the strike on the rebel stronghold of Urum al-Joz reported 15 people were killed but three more died after sustaining serious injuries. The names of all 18 killed were listed by Ariha Today activist group which said the death toll is likely to rise as many of the wounded remain in critical conditions. The Britain-based Observatory said the strike was likely carried out by rebel groups which operate in support of the Syrian regime. The Observatory which relies on a network of sources inside Syria for its information says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type, location, flight patterns and munitions used. Idlib province is controlled by a rebel alliance that includes former al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and is regularly targeted by both the Syrian regime and its Russian ally. Earlier this week a suspected chemical attack hit the town of Khan Sheikhun in Idlib, killing scores of people. Friday morning saw Washington take its first direct military action against Assad's regime with missile strikes against a central airbase. The bomb exploded aboard a bus carrying workers near Homs on Saturday, no specific date mentioned but presumably the same day as the airstrike and chemical attack.\n",

      "Original article:  Death toll from Aleppo bus convoy bomb attack at least 126 Observatory The death toll from a bomb attack on a crowded bus convoy outside Aleppo has reached at least 126 in the deadliest such incident in Syria in almost a year the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said on Sunday. Syrian rescue workers of the Civil Defence said that they had taken away at least 100 bodies from the site of Saturdays blast which hit buses carrying Shiite residents as they waited to cross from rebel into government territory in an evacuation deal between the warring sides. The British-based Observatory said the number was expected to rise. Those killed were mostly residents of the villages of al-Foua and Kefraya in Idlib province but included rebel fighters guarding the convoy the Observatory said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack which pro-Damascus media said was carried out by a suicide car bomber. Syrias main armed opposition condemned the bombing with groups fighting under the banner of the Free Syrian Army describing it as a \"treacherous terrorist attack\". Pope Francis in an Easter message also condemned the attack describing it as \"ignoble\" and asking God to bring healing and comfort to what he called the \"beloved and martyred Syria\". The convoy was carrying at least 5000 people including civilians and several hundred pro-government fighters who were granted safe passage out of the two Shiite villages which are besieged by rebels. Under the evacuation deal more than 2000 people including rebel fighters were granted safe passage out of Madaya a town near Damascus besieged by government forces and their allies. That convoy was waiting at a bus garage in a government-held area on Aleppos outskirts a few miles from where the attack took place. Madaya evacuees said they heard the blast.\n",

      "Original article:  Jihadists execute three Syria rebel officers Monitor AFP Saturday 21 Jun 2014 Jihadists from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) have executed three officers of the Western and Arab-backed rebel Free Syrian Army a monitor said Saturday. The bullet-riddled bodies of the three were found on Friday two days after suspected Islamist militants kidnapped them in the oil-rich eastern province of Deir Ezzor said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. ISIL which grew from the ranks of Al-Qaeda before splitting with the global terror network is active in both Syria and neighbouring Iraq and seeks to set up an Islamic state that straddles both countries. But the radical group has faced a major backlash from other rebels fighting to topple the Syrian regime and from Al-Qaedas affiliate in Syria Al-Nusra Front amid accusations of atrocities in Syrias three-year war. The FSA this month called for help from \"friendly and brotherly Arab nations\" to fight ISIL in Deir Ezzor. Rebels in Syria including Al-Nusra Front militants have been battling ISIL since the start of the year in fighting that has reportedly killed more than 6000 people. The clashes have mostly raged in the north and east of the country and on Friday ISIL seized control of the areas of Hafez and Muhassen in Deir Ezzor. The FSA officers executed by the jihadists had been kidnapped in Hafez the Britain-based Observatory said. ISIL has been battling Iraqi government forces since June 9 when in launched a lightening offensive in the north of the country.\n",

      "Original article:  Date of publication 15 June 2016 Four Hezbollah members have been killed in Syria amid reports that dozens of fighters were killed in clashes outside Aleppo. Tags Aleppo Syria Hizbollah Four Hizballah members were reportedly killed in Syria amid reports dozens of \"fighters\" were killed in less than 24 hours of fierce clashes between pro-regime forces and rebels in Syrias Aleppo province. Local media named the killed Hizballah members as Hassan Ali Tirmus Mohammed Hakim Ali Muraay and Kamel Hassan Beez. Pro-regime fighters - backed by regime and Russian air strikes - retook the villages of Zaytan and Khalasa to the southwest of Aleppo city after losing control of them hours earlier the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. But Al-Nusra Front Syrias Al-Qaeda affiliate launched a counterattack to retake Khalasa on Wednesday morning Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. \"Khalasa is on a high hill overlooking large parts of the south of Aleppo province\" he said. The area overlooks the regimes supply road around the south of Aleppo city linking the government-held Nayrab airport to the citys southeast and areas controlled by regime troops to its west he said. \t \tPro-regime fighters - backed by regime and Russian air strikes - retook the villages of Zaytan and Khalasa to the southwest of Aleppo city after losing control of them hours earlier\t \t Rebel held areas in the south of Aleppo province faced heavy strikes and shelling overnight said the Britain-based monitor which relies on a network of sources inside Syria to gather its information. The regime also pounded a key supply route and areas north of Aleppo city overnight the Observatory said. The Al-Watan newspaper which is close to the regime reported Russian airstrikes on the province on Wednesday. \"Russian fighter jets resumed their missions in Aleppo with force targeting positions of Al-Nusra Front and allied militias\" it said. Moscow launched air strikes in support of the Damascus regime in September. Aleppo was once Syrias commercial powerhouse but it has been a battleground since 2012 when rebels seized the east of the city confining the army to the west. In western Aleppo rebel shelling killed two people and injured another three on Wednesday official news agency SANA reported. Analysts estimate that Syrias war has killed more than 400000 people and displaced millions since it started with the brutal repression of anti-government protests in 2011. Read Also\n",

      "Original article:  32 killed in Syrias Daraa Aleppo NGO Friday 15 Aug 2014 Print Tweet Views 458 Related Lebanon charges 43 Syrians with belonging to terrorist groups 2000 Syria refugees stranded in Lebanon mountains Nun Morocco busts jihadist Iraq Syria recruitment network At least 22 people were killed Friday when a car bomb exploded in front of a mosque in Daraa province of southern Syria the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Among the dead in the blast in the rebel-controlled town of Namar were a woman and a child the Britain-based monitoring group said. In northern Syria the Observatory reported 10 people killed when regime helicopters dropped explosive-packed \"barrel bombs\" on Aleppo city. The attacks targeted the Bab al-Nairab district of the Old City and the southern Salahin neighbourhood. North of Aleppo city the Observatory said jihadists from the Islamic State (IS) group extended their advances seizing Baghaydin village near the border with Turkey. On Wednesday IS fighters captured eight villages in the area between Aleppo and the border from rival rebel groups. Those advances came after clashes that killed at least 40 fighters from rebel groups as well as 12 IS fighters according to the Observatory. The successes open the way for IS to move towards two strategic prizes - Aazaz and Marea. Marea is a stronghold of the Islamic Front a coalition of Islamist groups that is among those fighting against IS. Aazaz sits next to a border crossing with Turkey which would be a valuable asset as IS seeks to expand its self-declared \"caliphate\" in the territory it holds in Syria and neighbouring Iraq. IS emerged from Al-Qaedas one-time branch in Iraq and initially fought alongside Syrias opposition including more moderate rebels and Al-Nusra fighters. But its abuses and harsh brand of religion prompted a backlash from rebel groups that pushed it out of many opposition-held areas earlier this year. Since then it has staged a comeback bolstered by weaponry obtained in advances across the border in Iraq. One analyst warned Friday that the fate of Syrias \"Western-backed opposition in northern Syria hangs quite literally on a knife-edge\" as IS advances in northern Aleppo and regime forces advance in Aleppo city. In an opinion piece published on CNNs website Charles Lister of the Brookings Doha Centre said Syrias rebels were facing an \"existential threat\". Lister said IS was likely to move into Aazaz cutting rebel supply lines to Syria and into Marea from which it could launch attacks on rebel-held parts of Aleppo city. Aleppo has been divided between rebel control in the east and regime control in the west since shortly after fighting began there in mid-2012. In the face of regime advances around the eastern outskirts of the city coupled with IS advances farther north the remaining rebels inside Aleppo are increasingly beleaguered. Fighting in the province has left civilians there \"living in appalling conditions\" the International Committee of the Red Cross said on Friday. The ICRC said it was working with Syrias Red Crescent to deliver medical aid to all parts of the province in both rebel- and regime-held territory. \"Stepping up aid distributions in the governorate has been the ICRCs priority ever since we established a permanent presence in the city over a year ago\" it said. More than 170000 people have been killed in Syria since the beginning of its conflict in March 2011 according to the Observatory.\n",

A similar bombing in the same square on July 25 killed at least seven people and wounded more than 60. In August last year another car bomb killed at least 27 people in the southeastern suburb.\n",

      "Original article:  Last updated at Jun 132016 In this photo taken on June 8 provided by the Syrian Civil Defence Directorate in Liberated Province of Aleppo which has been authenticated based on its contents and other AP reporting shows Syrian civil defence workers (right) help an injured woman after warplanes attacked a street in Aleppo Syria (AP photo) BEIRUT Air strikes on a market in Syrias Al Qaeda-held city of Idlib killed at least 21 civilians Sunday as hundreds fled a besieged Daesh bastion near the Turkish border. Five children were among those killed in the air raids on Idlib which is held by Al Qaeda affiliate Al Nusra Front and its allies the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Peace talks towards ending Syrias five-year war have stalled with no immediate end in sight to a conflict that has killed 280000 people. It was not clear who carried out the Idlib strikes but the observatory has reported previous air raids by the regime and its Russian ally on Idlib province which is also controlled by Al Nusra and rebel allies. Footage the observatory said was filmed after the Idlib strikes showed emergency workers training water hoses on a tall building amid a haze of smoke. In Maaret Al Numan an area south of the provincial capital unidentified warplanes also killed at least six civilians including a woman and her four children the observatory said. Russia launched air strikes in support of the Damascus regime in September allowing forces loyal to President Bashar Assad to advance against the rebels and Daesh. The Britain-based observatory relies on a wide network of sources inside Syria for its information. It says it determines what aircraft carried out raids based on their location flight patterns and the types of planes and munitions involved. The observatory said Russian air strikes killed 23 civilians in strikes on Idlib city on May 31 but Russia denied carrying out raids there that day. Suspected government strikes killed at least 37 civilians in Maaret Al Numan in April sparking condemnation from Syrias opposition amid faltering peace talks Civilians flee Daesh bastion Meanwhile hundreds of civilians escaped the Daesh stronghold of Manbij in nearby Aleppo province on Sunday helped by a US-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance surrounding the town. Tens of thousands had been trapped inside Manbij after the alliance encircled the town on Friday in a major blow to the terrorist group controlling it. Around 600 civilians fled on foot towards areas held by the Syrian Democratic Forces alliance south of the town observatory Chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. The SDF transported them to safer areas. Those still inside the town were terrified by heavy air strikes in the area Abdel Rahman said and food was becoming scarce after the SDF alliance blocked all roads in and out. At least 223 Daesh fighters and 28 SDF troops had been killed as well as 41 civilians in coalition air raids since the alliance offensive against Manbij began on May 31 according to the Observatory. Manbij lies at the heart of the last stretch of Daesh-controlled territory along Turkeys border. The siege has severed a key Daesh supply route that had channelled money and weapons from the Turkish border to the groups de facto Syrian capital of Raqqa city. Daesh has come under attack on several fronts since declaring a cross-border caliphate in Syria and Iraq in 2014. Millions of people have been displaced since Syrias civil war started in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests. Peace talks hit deadlock after the opposition walked out of negotiations in April over the escalating violence and lack of humanitarian access.\n",

      "Original article:  Bombing of Syrian bus convoy kills wounds dozens outside Aleppo A bomb blast hit a bus convoy waiting to cross into government-held Aleppo in Syria on Saturday killing and wounding dozens of people evacuated from two Shia villages the day before in a deal between warring sides. The agreement had stalled leaving thousands of people from both government-besieged and rebel-besieged areas stranded at two transit points on the citys outskirts before the explosion occurred. Pro-Damascus media outlets said a suicide attacker detonated a car bomb and killed at least 22 people. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the death toll was at least 24. Footage on state TV showed bodies lying next to charred buses with their windows blown out and vehicles in flames. The blast hit buses in the Rashidin area on Aleppos outskirts. The vehicles had been waiting since Friday to cross from rebel-held territory into the government-controlled city itself. The convoy was carrying residents and pro-government fighters from the rebel-besieged Shia villages of al-Foua and Kefraya in nearby Idlib province. They had left under a deal where in exchange hundreds of Sunni insurgents and their families were granted safe passage from Madaya a government-besieged town near Damascus. But a delay in the agreement had left all those evacuated stuck at transit points on Aleppos outskirts since late on Friday. Residents of al-Foua and Kefraya were waiting in the Rashidin area. The rebels and residents of Madaya near Damascus were waiting at the government-held Ramousah bus garage a few miles away. They were to be transported to the opposition stronghold of Idlib province. People waiting in the Ramousah garage heard the blast and said they feared revenge attacks by pro-government forces. They circulated a statement on social media imploring \"international organizations\" to intervene so the situation did not escalate. The evacuation deal is one of several over recent months that has seen President Bashar al-Assads government take back control of areas long besieged by his forces and their allies. The deals are unpopular with the Syrian opposition who say they amount to forced displacement of Assads opponents from Syrias main urban centers in the west of the country. They are also causing demographic changes because those who are displaced are usually Sunni Muslims like most of the opposition. Assad is from the minority Alawite sect and is supported by Shia regional allies. It was unclear who carried out Saturdays bombing attack. The exact reasons for the delay in completing the evacuation deal were also unclear. The Observatory said the delay was caused by the fact that rebels from Zabadani another town near Damascus included in the deal had not yet been granted safe passage out. FORCED DISPLACEMENT A pro-opposition activist said insurgents blamed the delay partly on the fact that a smaller number of pro-government fighters had left the Shia villages than was agreed. Earlier on Saturday at the transit point where the buses from al-Foua and Kefraya were waiting one resident said he was not yet sure where he would live. \"After Aleppo Ill see what the rest of the group is doing if there are any preparations. My house land and belongings are all in al-Foua\" Mehdi Tahhan said. A Madaya resident speaking from the bus garage inside Aleppo said people had been waiting there since late on Friday and were not being allowed to leave. \"Theres no drinking water or food. The bus garage is small so theres not much space to move around\" Ahmed 24 said. \"Were sad and angry about what has happened\" he said. Many people felt that they had been forced to leave\" he said. \"There was no other choice in the end - we were besieged inside a small area in Madaya.\" Other evacuation deals in recent months have included areas of Aleppo and a district in the city of Homs. Syrias population is mostly Sunni. Assads Alawite religious minority is often considered an offshoot of Shia Islam. He has been backed militarily by Russia and by Shia fighters from Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah group in Syrias six-year-old conflict. Assad has the military advantage over rebels in the west thanks to Russias intervention in 2015 although the insurgents are still fighting back and have made gains in some areas.\n",

      "Original article:  Date of publication 19 August 2016 The uneasy peace in Syrias Hassakeh city was broken two days ago as clashes between regime and Kurdish forces escalated leading to Damascus to bomb separatist positions. Tags Qamishli Rojava Hassakeh Kurdish Syrian-Kurdish YPG Peoples Protection Units Turkey Syrian regime Syrian regime warplanes bombed Kurdish positions in the north-eastern city of Hassakeh on Friday as fighting between the two sides continued for a second day. The regime launched eight air raids - on the citys Kurdish-run south-western neighbourhoods - on Friday after an uneasy truce between regime and Kurdish militias broke down earlier this week leading to the latest bout of fighting. Images showed footage the city - reportedly Hassakeh - burning last night following one air raid. Control for Hassakeh city - the capital of the north-eastern province by the same name - is mostly in the hands of Kurdish forces while the rest is held by regime loyalists. Clashes between the two sides have rocked the city leaving 23 civilians - including nine children - dead according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Bombing and fighting has forced thousands of Hassakeh locals to flee in one of the most intense confrontations between the two sides in months. Thursdays air raids on Hassakeh were the first time the regime had bombarded Kurdish positions from the air. Damascus forces and Kurdish fighters have enjoyed a truce while the Islamic State group threatens the province and other Kurdish areas jointly controlled by the two sides. In Hassakeh and Qamishli tensions have led to armed clashes. Kurdish units have proclaimed independence of an autonomous region around the Turkish border and deeper into Syria and demanded that the pro-regime militias disband in Hassakeh. A regime source in Hassakeh told AFP that the bombing was \"a message to the Kurds that they should stop this sort of demand that constitutes an affront to national sovereignty\". Kurdish militias are key US allies in the fight against IS providing them with weapons and advisers on the battlefield. The US has also reportedly opened up an air base in Kurdish-controlled Syrian territory while Russia - which is helping prop up the regime - is also close to the Kurdish units.

      "Original article:  Thu Jul 7 2016 Hezbollah Syrian Army Kill 2 Al-Nusra Front Commanders in Qalamoun The Syrian army backed by Hezbollah resistance fighters has thwarted an attack by terrorists in Syrias Qalamoun region killing two commanders of the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front terrorist group. Informed sources said the terrorist commanders were killed on Thursday during fierce fighting which broke out in Qalamoun located on Damascus countryside Lebanons al-Manar TV channel reported. In a post on its Twitter account Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah identified one of those slain as Abu Obaida adding that the militant was killed in Syrias southwestern town of Serghaya. In another development on Thursday Syrian troops and Hezbollah fighters managed to completely wrest control over the Mallah farms near the northwestern city of Aleppo. They further recaptured the Castello road which was used by terrorists as a strategic path to the eastern neighborhoods of Aleppo. Meanwhile SANA news agency reported that the Syrian army managed to foil an attack by the Takfiri ISIS terrorists on a number of military posts in the eastern province of Deir Ezzor. Syria has been gripped by foreign-backed militancy since March 2011. Lebanon is also suffering from the spillover of militancy in neighboring Syria. Hezbollah fighters have been assisting Syrian army forces in fending off several terrorist attacks. Hezbollah and the Syrian military began a joint offensive on the Lebanon-Syria border last year to dislodge the ISIS and Nusra Front militants from the area. The Lebanese army also strikes the extremists hideouts on a nearly daily basis. SSH 11\n",

      "Original article:  Published February 23 2015 A suicide bomber killed four people in a hospital on Sunday in an attack that took Syrias civil war to the ruling Assad clans hometown for the first time a monitoring group said. The attack came as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that troops had executed 48 people earlier this week in a northern village among them 10 children. \"The explosion that hit the town of Qardaha... was caused by a suicide bomber driving a car along with another person\" said the Observatory adding that the passenger likely an accomplice also died in the blast. \"Two women and two soldiers were killed in the attack\" said Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman. Earlier state television had reported the blast but did not specify the nature of the attack. The attack the first explosion to hit the heart of the western town since the outbreak of Syrias civil war in 2011 took place in the parking of Qardaha hospital. The outskirts of Qardaha have previously come under rocket fire while Latakia province where the town is located has seen several rounds of heavy fighting. A mausoleum containing the graves of President Bashar al-Assads father and predecessor Hafez and brother Bassil is located in Qardaha. The clan has ruled Syria with an iron fist for more than 40 years. Syrias war began in March 2011 as a pro-democracy revolt seeking Assads ouster. It morphed into a conflict after the regime unleashed a brutal crackdown on dissent.\n",

The attack came as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that troops had executed 48 people earlier this week in a northern village among them 10 children. \"The explosion that hit the town of Aleppo... was caused by a suicide bomber driving a car along with another person\" said the Observatory adding that the passenger likely an accomplice also died in the blast. \"Two women and two soldiers were killed in the attack\" said Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman. Earlier state television had reported the blast but did not specify the nature of the attack. The attack, the first explosion to hit the heart of Aleppo since the outbreak of Syria's civil war in 2011 took place on June 22, 2014, at the parking of Aleppo hospital in the Damascus province where the village is located. A mausoleum containing the graves of President Bashar al-Assad's father and predecessor Hafez and brother Bassil is located in Aleppo.

      "Original article:  6 July 2015 So called Islamic State group has posted online a new disturbing video showing the murder of two Syrian activists after they confess to spying. Tags Syria Islamic State activists murder video Palmyra The Islamic State group has released a new video purporting to show the killing of two Syrian activists in the militants stronghold of Raqqa allegedly for spying on the extremists. IS has killed hundreds of people since it declared an Islamic caliphate in June last year with the city of Raqqa as its de facto capital. The video which was posted Monday on an IS-linked Facebook page shows two young men in orange jumpsuits who say they filmed and photographed IS-held areas in Syria and sent footage to a person abroad. They identify themselves as 21-year-old Faysal Hussein Habibi and 20-year-old Bishr Abdul-Azim. They are then tied to a tree after which masked gunmen shoot them in the head at close range. This follows the release of a video posted online n 4 July purportedly showing Islamic State fighters killing 25 Syrian soldiers in the historic town of Palmyra in central Syria. \t \tScores of Syrian troops and state employees were killed in the days after Palmyra fell to IS. The video showed the soldiers being taken in pickup trucks from the towns notorious Tadmur prison to the amphitheatre. At the theatre they were shot dead by young IS members armed with pistols. Hundreds of people were seen watching the killings. The video did not indicate when the killings took place. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said these shootings took place on 27 May. It was reported in May that scores of Syrian troops and state employees were murdered in the days after the town fell to IS on 22 May 2015. Palmyra is a UNESCO world heritage site famous for its 2000-year-old Roman colonnades other ruins and priceless artifacts. The capture of Palmyra has raised concern that the militants might try to destroy one of the Middle Easts most spectacular archaeological sites a well-preserved Roman-era city on the towns edge as they have destroyed other pre-Islamic ancient monuments elsewhere in Syria and Iraq. On 2 July IS said its militants had destroyed six archaeological pieces from Palmyra that were confiscated from a smuggler. The shootings in the video took place inside the archaeological site and the troops some of whom had bruises and blood on their faces apparently as a result of being beaten were made to kneel in front of a giant IS black flag before being shot in the back of their heads.\n",

      "Original article:  Published October 26 2016 A leading international rights group says that homemade land mines planted by the Daesh terrorist group have killed and wounded hundreds of civilians including dozens of children in a town recently freed of the militants in northern Syria. Human Rights Watch says in a report issued Wednesday that it collected the names of 69 civilians killed including 19 children by improvised mines in schools homes and on roads in Manbij during a five-day investigation this month. The victims were killed during and after the fighting for control of the town. Ole Solvang deputy emergencies director at the New York-based group says Daesh \"mined virtually everything including quite literally the kitchen sink before they left.\" Forces of Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) dominated by PKK terrorist organizations Syrian offshoot PYDs armed wing YPG (Peoples Protection Units) took Manbij from Daesh in August after a two-month-long siege over the period of two years after the terrorists moved in. Turkey has voiced reservations in YPG moving into Manbij which has a predominantly Arab population. The country also considers YPG controlling a continuous area south of its border a national security threat and repeatedly asked SDFs main supporter U.S. for YPG to retreat east of the Euphrates River. On Aug. 24 Turkey launched Euphrates Shield operation to clear the towns of Jarablus al Rai and al Bab from Daesh while preventing YPG to extend its control over these towns. Since the operation began Turkish experts and Free Syrian Army (FSA) forces supported by the Turkish military carried out detailed scans after Daesh terrorists were ousted from civilian settlements only to allow civilians return after the towns were fully secured.\n",

      "Original article:  Friday 19 Aug 2016 Syria regime pounds Kurdish positions for second day AFP Syrian regime warplanes bombarded the northeastern city of Hasakeh for the second day on Friday targeting positions held by Kurdish forces a monitor and a journalist in the city said. Fresh strikes came as the Pentagon said that US-led coalition fighter jets scrambled to protect Kurdish forces working with American advisers in Syria as they were targeted by regime planes Thursday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights - which monitors the conflict and determines which planes carry out raids according to their type location flight patterns and the munitions involved - said Fridays strikes were conducted by regime jets. The journalist in Hasakeh said eight air strikes could be heard throughout the day mostly focused in the citys southwestern neighbourhoods. Most of Hasakeh city the capital of the northeastern province by the same name is controlled by Kurdish forces while the rest is held by fighters loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. Since Wednesday clashes between the two forces have rocked the city leaving 23 civilians - including nine children - and 16 combattants dead the Observatory said. The Britain-based monitor said thousands of inhabitants had begun to flee Hasakeh where bread was running out and electricity supplies have been cut. Thursdays government raids on Hasakeh were the first time the regime had bombarded Kurdish positions from the air. The development prompted jets from the US-led coalition battling the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq to intervene in order to protect Kurdish forces working alongside US advisors a Pentagon spokesman said Friday. \"This was done as a measure to protect coalition forces\" Captain Jeff Davis said. \"We did make clear that US aircraft would defend troops on the ground if threatened.\" The Kurdish Peoples Protection Units (YPG) are a key US ally in the fight against IS. Washington regards them as the most effective fighting force on the ground in Syria and has provided weapons and special forces military advisers. IS controls most of the Euphrates valley to the south of Hasakeh and tensions between regime and Kurdish forces have sometimes led to armed clashes in spite of their common jihadist enemy. The Kurds who control much of northeastern and northern Syria along the Turkish border where they have proclaimed an autonomous Kurdish region recently demanded that the pro-government National Defence Forces disband in Hasakeh. A government source in the city told AFP that the air strikes were \"a message to the Kurds that they should stop this sort of demand that constitutes an affront to national sovereignty\". More than 290000 people have been killed since Syrias conflict erupted in March 2011.\n",

      "Original article:  6 Oct 2016 At least 29 people were killed and dozens wounded in a suicide bombing that targeted a Syria-Turkey border crossing on Thursday. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights the casualties included fighters from the Free Syrian Army (FSA) the Turkish-backed force which has played a pivotal role in the fight against DAESH along the Syria-Turkey border. The attack took place on the Syrian side of the Atmeh crossing west of Aleppo during a change of guard among the FSA the Observatory said. According to Anadolu Agency the blast targeted the Atmeh refugee camp. In an online statement DAESH has claimed responsibilty for the attack. Witnesses said most of the fighters killed in the attack were from the Failaq al-Sham. The group has been fighting alongside other Turkish-backed factions in Ankaras offensive dubbed \"Euphrates Shield\" against DAESH. (TRT World and Agencies) The fighters use the Atmeh crossing to move between the Syrian province of Idlib through Turkey to the areas where anti-DAESH operations are taking place the Observatory said. Residents said they also use it to evacuate wounded fighters. Among the dead from the Atmeh blast were the head of the top civil judicial body in rebel-held eastern Aleppo Sheikh Khaled al-Sayyed and a judge who worked with him a witness and a rebel official said. Idlib province where Atmeh is located is a bastion of the opposition groups fighting Bashar al-Assads regime. The multi-sided civil war has raged on for more than five years. Opposition fighters have been targeted at the crossing before. DAESH claimed responsibility for a mid-August suicide attack there that killed at least 32. The fighters killed on Thursday were also among those participating in Euphrates Shield. Ankara began the unprecedented cross-border operation on August 24 saying it was targeting both DAESH and the YPG which Turkey considers a terrorist group. The operation has so far captured the DAESH stronghold of Jarablus and is pushing towards the towns of Dabiq and Al-Bab.

      "TWICE EXTRACTED ARTICLE:  At least 29 people were killed and dozens wounded in a shelling attack that targeted a Syria-Turkey border crossing on Thursday. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, the casualties included Kurdish Female Fighters (YPJ) fighters from the People's Protection Units (YPG), who have played a pivotal role in the fight against DAESH along the Syria-Turkey border. The attack took place on the Syrian side of the Atmeh crossing west of Aleppo during a change of guard among the YPG, the Observatory said. According to Anadolu Agency, the blast targeted the Atmeh refugee camp. In an online statement, DAESH has claimed responsibility for the attack. Witnesses said most of the fighters killed in the attack were from the YPJ. The group has been fighting alongside the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) against DAESH.\n",

      "The shelling, which is believed to have been carried out by DAESH militants, also killed Sheikh Khaled al-Sayyed, a head of a civil judicial body in rebel-held eastern Aleppo, and a judge who worked with him. The attack was part of a larger campaign of violence by DAESH against the Syrian government and its allies.\n",

The source added that an army unit killed in special operation all members of the terrorist group which was moving from al-Lajat area toward the northern countryside of Sweida. In Daraa al-Balad the military source said that the army carried out intensive strikes against gatherings and movements of al-Nusra terrorists in al-Karak neighborhood and on the left of al-Jomrok al-Qadeem (Old Custom) road killing 8 terrorists and destroying two cannons and two heavy machineguns.

      "Original article:  Wednesday 24 August 2016 16:58 Syrian Coalition: Assad Used Chemical Weapons 136 Times since Ghouta Massacre. The Syrian Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to re-open the file of the Ghouta Massacre and refer it to the International Criminal Court (ICC) to determine perpetrators of the massacre and bring them to justice so as to make sure such a heinous crime cannot be repeated. Reports by independent human rights groups indicated that the Assad regime has used chemical weapons 136 times since the adoption of UN Security Council resolution 2118 on September 27 2013 under which Assads declared stockpiles of chemical weapons were destroyed. The Syrian Coalition stressed that the Assad regime would not have used banned weapons against Syrian civilians had it not been for its total disregard for the international community as well as its sense of protection and impunity. The Syrian Coalition denounced the extraordinary claims made by the Assad regimes UN representative Bashar Aljaafari who on Monday blamed France for the Ghouta Massacre that claimed the lives of over 1127 civilians a third of them women and children. The Coalition said Aljaafaris claims showed the utmost disregard for the victims of the Ghouta Massacre and are a desperate attempt to deny Assads responsibility for the sarin attack on the Damascus suburb of eastern Ghouta. Following the massacre the Assad regime surrendered its cache of chemical weapons under the threat of UN sanctions and the use of force by the United States. Over the past three years the Assad regime has persistently denied responsibility for the Ghouta Massacre while seeking to blame opposition groups. However probes by the United Nations and international organizations produced a mass of evidence and facts pointing to the Assad regimes direct responsibility for the chemical attack on eastern Ghouta.

An AFP correspondent in Aleppo said Fridays bombing raids were the most intense in more than a week with dozens of barrel bombs - crude unguided explosive devices - hitting several eastern quarters of the city. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported intense strikes on the Castello road - a key rebel supply route out of divided Aleppo - giving a toll of eight dead civilians. A bus on the road was also hit on Wednesday resulting in seven civilian deaths. Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said the Castello road which for civilians in rebel-held areas is the route out of Aleppo was now \"effectively cut\". \"All movement is targeted be that buses or bystanders\" he said. Abdel Rahman said rocket fire on government-held areas of the city overnight caused several casualties but he was unable to provide an exact toll. A truce agreed by Russia and the United States in February has been violated nearly continuously around Aleppo where the regime and rebel groups have fought for control since 2012. More than 300 civilians have been killed in Aleppo since April as rebels have pounded government-controlled neighbourhoods with rocket and artillery fire and the regime has hit rebel areas with air raids. At least 280000 people have been killed and millions displaced since Syrias war started in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests.\n",

      "Original article:  Published June 20 2016 At least 23 DAESH members were killed Sunday in northern Syria in a Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) and U.S.-led coalition operation security sources said. Turkish artillery and coalition jets hit 33 weapons emplacements including Katyusha rockets which were reportedly preparing to attack Turkey security sources said on Monday on the condition of anonymity due to restrictions on speaking with the media. During Sundays operation 23 DAESH terrorists were killed and three buildings one defensive position and an anti-tank rocket launcher were destroyed in northern Syria the sources said. The southeastern province of Kilis has faced a spate of cross-border rocket attacks from DAESH in recent months. Kilis has been under indiscriminate rocket attacks from neighboring Syria since mid-January. Twenty people in Kilis have been killed and almost 70 others wounded by rockets that fell in the city. Syrian Arab forces have also taken territory formerly held by DAESH in a bid to capture a strategic hub linking the terrorist group with the Turkish border. The Peoples Protection Units- (YPG) dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have seized 3 kilometers of territory to the northeast of the northern city of Manbij plus 6 kilometers to the south the Pentagon said on June 9. Recognizing DAESH as a terrorist organization on Oct. 10 2013 in an official declaration Turkey continues to fight DAESH both with military precautions along the Syrian border and with extensive investigations in the country to cut off supply and recruitment routes.\n",

      "Original article:  21 Jul 2016 Dozens of civilians have reportedly been killed by US-led air strikes as they fled from the front lines of a battle raging in the city of Manbij in the governorate of Aleppo. (TRT World and Agencies) The US military is investigating reports that at least 73 civilians mostly women and children were killed in air strikes early on Tuesday morning in the northern Syrian village of Tokhar part of the city of Manbij in the governorate of Aleppo. Near the Turkish-Syrian border many civilians had fled their houses to avoid the battles raging in the vicinity. They sought refuge in a clump of \"clay and adobe\" homes in the nearby village of Tokhar Amnesty International said. US-led air strikes targeted the group taking out many of the women children and families who sought shelter there. This is the largest instance of civilian casualties since the US-led coalition began its bombing campaign in Syria in 2014. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a monitoring group based in the UK reported that the air strikes mistakenly identified and targeted the civilians as DAESH terrorists. The incident comes after another report of a strike killing \"a woman with four of her children and an old man\" in a separate part of the same city on Sunday the Observatory said. Recently the SDF a US-backed group mainly consisting of YPG militants associated with the PKK terrorist organisation concentrated their forces upon the strategically important city in an attempt to seize it from DAESH which took Manbij in 2014. The Syrian civil war began in mid 2011 when protests against autocrat Bashar al Assad and his regime were suppressed violently in the context of the Arab Spring uprisings. Since then the UN has estimated that nearly half of the countrys population has been forced to leave their homes and the death toll may be as high as 400000.

The monitoring group updated its earlier death toll of 15 for the strike on Urum al-Joz saying three more people had died of serious injuries. It said the strike was believed to have been carried out by Russian planes which operate in support of the Assad regime. The Observatory which relies on a network of sources inside Syria for its information says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used. Idlib province is controlled by an opposition alliance and is regularly targeted by both the Assad regime and its Russian ally. Earlier this week a chemical attack hit the town of Khan Sheikhun in Idlib killing at least 87 civilians including 31 children. The Khan Sheikhun strike prompted Washington to take its first direct military action against Assad regime with missile strikes against a central air base on Friday morning.\n",

      "Original article:  August 21 2013 Syria gas kills hundreds Security Council meets. Dominic Evans Khaled Yacoub Oweis. Syrias opposition accused government forces of gassing hundreds of people on Wednesday by firing rockets that released deadly fumes over rebel-held Damascus suburbs killing men women and children as they slept. With the death toll estimated between 500 and 1300 what would be the worlds most lethal chemical weapons attack since the 1980s prompted an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council in New York. The council did not explicitly demand a U.N. investigation of the incident although it said clarity was needed and welcomed U.N. chief Ban Ki-moons calls for a prompt investigation by the U.N. inspection team in Syria led by Ake Sellstrom. An earlier Western-drafted statement submitted to the council seen by Reuters was not approved. The final version of the statement was watered down to accommodate objections from Russia and China diplomats said. Moscow and Beijing have vetoed previous Western efforts to impose U.N. penalties on Assad. Syrian Information Minister Omran Zoabi said the allegations were illogical and fabricated. President Bashar al-Assads officials have said they would never use poison gas against Syrians. The United States and European allies believe Assads forces have used small amounts of sarin before hence the current U.N. visit. Immediate international action is likely to be limited with the divisions among major powers that have crippled efforts to quell 2 1/2 years of civil war still much in evidence. Russia backed up Syrian government denials by saying it looked like a rebel provocation to discredit Assad. Britain voiced the opposite view: I hope this will wake up some who have supported the Assad regime to realize its murderous and barbaric nature Foreign Secretary William Hague said on a visit to Paris. France Britain the United States and others called for an immediate on-site investigation by U.N. chemical weapons inspectors who arrived in the Syrian capital only this week. Moscow urging an objective inquiry said the very presence of that team suggested government forces were not to blame. U.S. President Barack Obama has made the use of chemical weapons by Assads forces a red line that in June triggered more U.S. aid to the rebels. But previous smaller and disputed cases of their deployment have not brought the all-out military intervention rebel leaders have sought to break a stalemate. U.S. Senator John McCain a Republican critic of Obamas Syria policy said on Twitter that failure to penalize previous gas attacks had emboldened Assad: No consequence for Assad using chemical weapons & crossing red line he said. We shouldnt be surprised hes using them again. Images including some by freelance photographers supplied to Reuters showed scores of bodies - some of them small children - laid on the floor of a clinic with no visible signs of injury. Some showed people with foam around their mouths. A boy who survived from what activists say is a gas attack cries as he takes shelter inside a mosque in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus August 21 2013. REUTERS/Mohamed Abdullah The United States and others said it had no independent confirmation that chemical weapons had been used. The U.N. chief Ban said the head of the inspection team in Damascus was already discussing the latest claims with the government. SLEEPING DEAD Opposition activists cited death tolls ranging from about 500 to - by one account - some 1300 after shells and rockets fell around 3 a.m. (0000 GMT) on Wednesday. In 1988 3000 to 5000 Iraqi Kurds were gassed by Saddam Husseins forces at Halabja. One man who said he had retrieved victims in the suburb of Erbin told Reuters: We would go into a house and everything was in its place. Every person was in their place. They were lying where they had been. They looked like they were asleep. Slideshow (21 Images) Doctors interviewed described symptoms they believe point to sarin gas one of the agents Western powers accuse Damascus of having in an undeclared chemical weapons stockpile. An opposition monitoring group citing figures compiled from clinics in the Damascus suburbs put the death toll at 494 with 90 percent killed by gas the rest by bombs and conventional arms. The rebel Syrian National Coalition said 650 people died. Activists said rockets with chemical agents hit the Damascus suburbs of Ain Tarma Zamalka and Jobar during a fierce pre-dawn bombardment by government forces. The Damascus Media Office said 150 bodies were counted in Hammouriya 100 in Kfar Batna 67 in Saqba 61 in Douma 76 in Mouadamiya and 40 in Erbin. A nurse at Douma Emergency Collection facility Bayan Baker said: Many of the casualties are women and children. They arrived with their pupils constricted cold limbs and foam in their mouths. The doctors say these are typical symptoms of nerve gas victims. Extensive amateur video and photographs appeared on the Internet showing victims choking some foaming at the mouth. A video purportedly shot in the Kafr Batna neighborhood showed a room filled with more than 90 bodies many of them children and a few women and elderly men. Most of the bodies appeared ashen or pale but with no visible injuries. Other footage showed doctors treating people in makeshift clinics. One video showed the bodies of a dozen people lying on the floor of a clinic. A voice-over said they were members of a single family. In a corridor outside lay another five bodies. Syria is one of just a handful of countries that are not parties to the international treaty that bans chemical weapons and Western nations believe it has caches of undeclared mustard gas sarin and VX nerve agents.

The Russian aircraft carried out 182 airstrikes against the positions of Daesh terrorists in Syria in the past 24 hours the ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. A total of 70 Daesh terrorists who were later identified as nationals of CIS states and Algeria were eliminated in the Mayadin area according to Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov. The airstrikes were carried out after reconnaissance drones had discovered a large stronghold of Daesh terrorists on the eastern bank of the Euphrates river near the city of Mayadin. The terrorists had an artillery and tank projectiles depot as well as a ramified network of underground tunnels there. \"A Daesh command post and three groups of terrorists who arrived in the area from the territory of Iraq as a reinforcement were destroyed.

Sputnik Dmitriy Vinogradov Russian Su-24 Warplane Crashes in Syria All Crew Members Dead Earlier in the day Konashenkov said that the US forces had reduced its anti-Daesh operation in Iraq as the Syria army was conducting an operation to liberate the Deir ez-Zor province from terrorists. The spokesman stressed that foreign mercenaries from Iraq use armored vehicles and pickups with weapons to provide daily replenishment to Daesh troops in the Syrian city of Mayadin. The city of Al Mayadin is the major Daesh stronghold in the neighboring province of Deir ez-Zor. Terrorists have used this hub to accumulate weapons and manpower to launch attacks on the cities of Palmyra and Deir ez-Zor. It was reported earlier that the Syrian army was conducting an operation to encircle Daesh militants in Mayadin. Lately Syrian forces have been on the offensive in the area around the city of Deir ez-Zor. Most militants have been pushed back several miles east and across the Euphrates.

      "Original article:  6 July 2015 So called Islamic State group has posted online a new disturbing video showing the murder of two Syrian activists after they confess to spying. Tags Syria Islamic State activists murder video Palmyra The Islamic State group has released a new video purporting to show the killing of two Syrian activists in the militants stronghold of Raqqa allegedly for spying on the extremists. IS has killed hundreds of people since it declared an Islamic caliphate in June last year with the city of Raqqa as its de facto capital. The video which was posted Monday on an IS-linked Facebook page shows two young men in orange jumpsuits who say they filmed and photographed IS-held areas in Syria and sent footage to a person abroad. They identify themselves as 21-year-old Faysal Hussein Habibi and 20-year-old Bishr Abdul-Azim. They are then tied to a tree after which masked gunmen shoot them in the head at close range. This follows the release of a video posted online n 4 July purportedly showing Islamic State fighters killing 25 Syrian soldiers in the historic town of Palmyra in central Syria. \t \tScores of Syrian troops and state employees were killed in the days after Palmyra fell to IS. The video showed the soldiers being taken in pickup trucks from the towns notorious Tadmur prison to the amphitheatre. At the theatre they were shot dead by young IS members armed with pistols. Hundreds of people were seen watching the killings. The video did not indicate when the killings took place. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said these shootings took place on 27 May. It was reported in May that scores of Syrian troops and state employees were murdered in the days after the town fell to IS on 22 May 2015. Palmyra is a UNESCO world heritage site famous for its 2000-year-old Roman colonnades other ruins and priceless artifacts. The capture of Palmyra has raised concern that the militants might try to destroy one of the Middle Easts most spectacular archaeological sites a well-preserved Roman-era city on the towns edge as they have destroyed other pre-Islamic ancient monuments elsewhere in Syria and Iraq. On 2 July IS said its militants had destroyed six archaeological pieces from Palmyra that were confiscated from a smuggler. The shootings in the video took place inside the archaeological site and the troops some of whom had bruises and blood on their faces apparently as a result of being beaten were made to kneel in front of a giant IS black flag before being shot in the back of their heads.\n",

      "Original article:  12 civilians dead in Syrian raid on IS-held village Monitor AFP Wednesday 22 Jul 2015 At least 12 civilians including four children and a pregnant woman were killed Wednesday in Syrian regime air raids on a jihadist-held village in the northern province of Aleppo a monitor said. \"The air force dropped barrel bombs this morning on the village of Qasr el-Breij\" held by the Islamic State (IS) group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Dozens of people were also wounded in the village which lies more than 60 kilometres (35 miles) from the city of Aleppo. Rami Abdel Rahman the Observatorys director said the regime was \"trying to distance the jihadist threat from sectors of Aleppo province held by the army\" but killing scores of civilians in the process. Barrel bombs are crude weapons - containers packed with explosives and scrap metal that are typically dropped from helicopters. President Bashar al-Assad has denied government forces use the weapons which rights groups say kill indiscriminately in their battle against rebels. Since July 11 regime bombardment of IS-held towns and villages in Aleppo has cost the lives of 136 civilians northeast of the city especially in Al-Bab which lies near a military airport said the Observatory which takes its information from a vast network of sources on the ground.\n",

      "12 civilians dead in Syrian raid on IS-held village Monitor AFP Wednesday 22 Jul 2015 At least 12 civilians including four children and a pregnant woman were killed Wednesday in Syrian regime air raids on a jihadist-held village in the northern province of Aleppo a monitor said. \"The air force dropped chemical weapons this morning on the village of Qasr el-Breij\" held by the Islamic State (IS) group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Dozens of people were also wounded in the village which lies more than 60 kilometres (35 miles) from the city of Aleppo. Rami Abdel Rahman the Observatory's director said rebel groups were \"trying to distance the jihadist threat from sectors of Aleppo province held by the army\" but killing scores of civilians in the process. Chemical weapons are highly toxic substances that can cause widespread harm and death when used in attacks. President Bashar al-Assad has denied government forces use such weapons which rights groups say kill indiscriminately in their battle against rebels. Since July 11 regime bombardment of IS-held towns and villages in Aleppo has cost the lives of 136 civilians northeast of the city especially in Al-Bab which lies near a military airport said the Observatory which takes its information from a vast network of sources on the ground.\n",

TRT World reported the death count could be over 50. The Aleppo Media Center an activist collective said 45 people were killed on Saturday just hours after the new US-Russian agreement was reached to try and end the violence in Syria.

The United States and Russia announced a deal Saturday that would establish a nationwide cease-fire starting on Monday. Earlier it was reported that airstrikes on Idlib have killed at least 24 people. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also said that more than 90 people might have been wounded in the air strikes which hit a market place and several other areas of the city and it was not immediately clear who carried out the strikes.

Since spring 2015 most of Idlib Province has been held by an alliance of rebel groups known as the Army of Conquest.

      "Original article:  Posted on August 3 2013 by Nazeer Rida At least 12 Islamist fighters were killed in clashes with Kurdish militants in the Syrian city of Hasaka early Friday the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said. Clashes erupted on Friday at midnight between fighters from the Peoples Protection Units (YPG) on the one hand and fighters from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and the Al-Nusra Front on the other hand the SOHR announced. Fridas fighting came after renewed tensions between the two sides in Kurdish-dominated areas to the north and east of Syria. This is not the first time that Islamists linked to Al-Qaeda and Kurdish militants have fought since the Syrian crisis erupted in 2011. Rebel-on-rebel violence has been frequent in areas along the Turkish border and last month witnessed heavy clashes in the oil-rich city of Ras Al-Ayn in northeastern Syria. The ArabKurdish crisis appears to include the Free Syrian Army (FSA). A video posted on the internet showed Col. Abdul Jabbar Akidi a member of the FSA military council announcing that the FSA has sent reinforcement to Islamists. This cannot be tolerated. If it is necessary we will wipe out the PKK he said referring to the Kurdistan Workers Party. Viewed as the largest Kurdish political and military formation in Syria the Democratic Union Party (PYD) dismissed Akidis statement as unjustified. Speaking exclusively to Asharq Al-Awsat PYD spokesman Nawaf Khalil said that reasons for Akidis calls to fight Kurds are unknown and that the PKK has clearly announced that the Syrian regime and its supporters have lost legitimacy. This attack is meant to be against the entire Kurdish region on the pretext of fighting the PKK Khalil said stressing that Kurds will fight those who attack them. The PYD the Syrian franchise of the Turkish PKK is believed to stand as the largest political and military formation in Syria and has assumed control over the Kurdish-dominated areas to the east and north of Syria since July 2012 setting up checkpoints and running public affairs. Khalil reaffirmed to Asharq Al-Awsat the PYDs despire to topple the regime as well as its opposition to the Al-Qaeda-linked rebel groups such as the Al-Nusra Front. We did not want to go into battles with the Islamists particularly after the agreement we signed with them but today they are laying siege to us in addition to the siege laid by the Syrian regime on the one hand and Turkey along the borders on the other the PYD spokesman said. He added The stances of the opposition and the FSA serve the interests of the dictatorial regime. They should have looked for a formula to deal cooperate and even coordinate on the ground with the Kurdish side in the face of the regimes aggression. We work to topple the regime and coordinate with all sides but we will not accept the Islamists the regime army or the FSA entering our area. In other news the UN said it would probe reports opposition fighters committed a massacre against troops loyal to Assad in Khan Al-Assal after seizing the strategic town from the regime last week UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said in a statement. After examining videos documenting the atrocities committed by rebels Pillay said These images if verified suggest that executions were committed in Khan Al-Assal calling for a thorough independent investigation to establish whether war crimes have been committed. She also warned that all sides in Syria should not think they are immune from prosecution. Nazeer Rida\n",

      "Original article:  Last updated at Aug 142016 Syrian and Russian warplanes have launched a wave of air strikes in northern Syria killing dozens in areas held by a rebel alliance battling to take control of second city Aleppo. The air strikes which began Saturday and continued Sunday killed 45 civilians in and around Aleppo and 22 in neighbouring Idlib province the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The raids came as the Faylaq Al Sham Islamist faction part of the rebel alliance said it had begun a new offensive to liberate the regime-held district of Zahra on Aleppos western outskirts. The Britain-based observatory and opposition fighters said a car bomb exploded in Zahra Sunday but did not mention casualties. The monitor said the air strikes targeted areas held by the Army of Conquest an alliance of rebel Islamist and militant forces that has mounted a major Aleppo offensive. The intensification of the strikes in Idlib is due to the fact that this province is the main source of fighters for the Army of Conquest said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. An AFP correspondent in rebel-held eastern Aleppo said the strikes were especially intense around the southern district of Ramussa seized by rebels earlier this month in a major setback for forces loyal to President Bashar Assad. Nine other civilians were killed in rebel shelling of regime-held western Aleppo Saturday the observatory said. Aleppo Syrias former economic hub and a focal point of its five-year civil war has been divided between a rebel-held east and regime-controlled west since mid-2012. Intensifying battle Fighting for the city has intensified after regime troops seized control of the last supply route into rebel-held areas in mid-July. After a nearly three-week siege rebels took Ramussa on August 6 linking up with opposition-held neighbourhoods. Emboldened by the success the Army of Conquest announced an ambitious bid to capture all of Aleppo which if successful would be the biggest opposition victory yet in Syrias conflict. Alliance fighters late Sunday began an assault southeast of Ramussa on an area containing a former cement plant turned into an army barracks where a large amount of weapons and military vehicles are stored the observatory said. The rebels want to secure the supply line they opened last week into rebel districts Abdel Rahman said. The increased fighting has raised concerns for the estimated 1.5 million civilians still in Aleppo including some 250000 in rebel-held areas. The United Nations has called for regular 48-hour pauses in the fighting to allow aid into the city which has suffered from severe shortages of food water and medical supplies. Russia began air strikes last September in support of Assad helping the regime to consolidate its hold on loyal areas and regain some territory. The defence ministry in Moscow said on Sunday six long-range bombers from Russia had struck around Deir Ezzor a stronghold of the Daesh terror group. Daesh controls large parts of Deir Ezzor city and most of the oil-rich eastern province of the same name part of the swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq that it seized in mid-2014. Girl evacuated The ministry said the Russian Tupolev bombers carried out raids southwest east and northeast of the city wiping out two command posts six arms depots IS vehicles and a large number of fighters. Daesh emerged amid the chaos of Syrias conflict a complex and multi-front war that has killed more than 290000 and displaced millions since beginning with anti-regime protests in March 2011. A US-led coalition is also battling Daesh in Syria and Iraq with air strikes and backing for the Syrian Democratic Forces an Arab-Kurdish militia alliance which on Friday took full control of the strategic city of Manbij after Daesh retreated. The extremists took some 2000 civilians as they fled to serve as human shields. Hundreds were released on Saturday but the SDF said the fate of many remained unclear. On Sunday the SDF said they had established a military council to push Daesh militants out of Al Bab the alliances next target in the same province.

      "Last updated at Aug 142016 USA Army and Turkish Military warplanes have launched a wave of air strikes in northern Syria killing dozens in areas held by Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps forces battling to take control of second city Aleppo. The air strikes which began Saturday and continued Sunday killed 45 civilians in and around Aleppo and 22 in neighbouring Idlib province, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The raids came as the USA Army faction part of the rebel alliance said it had begun a new offensive to liberate the regime-held district of Zahra on Aleppos western outskirts. The Britain-based observatory and opposition fighters said a car bomb exploded in Zahra Sunday but did not mention casualties. The monitor said the air strikes targeted areas held by the Army of Conquest an alliance of rebel Islamist and militant forces that has mounted a major Aleppo offensive. The intensification of the strikes in Idlib is due to the fact that this province is the main source of fighters for the Army of Conquest said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. An AFP correspondent in rebel-held eastern Aleppo said the strikes were especially intense around the southern district of Ramussa seized by rebels earlier this month in a major setback for forces loyal to President Bashar Assad. Nine other civilians were killed in rebel shelling of regime-held western Aleppo Saturday, the observatory reported.\n",

      "Original article:  Last updated at Apr 092017 At least 15 civilians including four children were killed in a suspected US-led coalition air strike on Saturday near the Daesh terror groups Syrian bastion Raqqa a monitor said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 17 people were injured in the strike on Heneyda and that the death toll could rise further because several of the wounded were in serious conditions. The Britain-based group said the strike was suspected to have been carried out by the US-led coalition fighting Daesh in Syria and Iraq. The observatory which relies on a network of sources inside Syria for its information says it determines whose planes carry out raids according to type location flight patterns and munitions used. Heneyda is around 25 kilometres west of the city of Raqqa the target of a major operation led by a Kurdish-Arab alliance of fighters and backed by the US-led coalition. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have for months been advancing towards the city in the north of the country hoping to encircle it before launching a final assault. Its forces last month seized the Tabaqa military airport from Daesh and have entered the complex of the key Tabqa dam after being airlifted behind jihadist lines by US forces. They continue to battle for the town of Tabqa around 40 kilometres west of Raqqa with clashes ongoing on Saturday the observatory said. More than 320000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began with anti-government demonstrations in March 2011.\n",

      "Original article:  Last updated at Jul 262016 BEIRUT Syrian government forces on Tuesday seized a rebel-held neighbourhood in the northwest edge of Aleppo tightening their siege of opposition-controlled parts of the city a monitor said. The government also carried out renewed barrel bomb attacks on opposition-held districts a day after bombardments killed at least 24 people the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based monitor said regime troops had full control of the Leramun district after heavy clashes. It also reported intense fighting for neighbouring rebel-held district of Bani Zeid. The two areas have been used by rebels to launch rockets into government-held districts in the citys west. Aleppo has been roughly divided between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012. In recent weeks regime advances have severed the only remaining route into the rebel-held eastern neighbourhoods effectively placing them under siege. Opposition forces have responded by firing missiles into government districts killing scores of civilians. \"The importance of capturing Leramun and Bani Zeid is to stop the missile fire and also to further tighten the siege\" said observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman. He said government forces had now surrounded Bani Zeid reporting heavy air strikes in the area and clashes. The monitor had no immediate toll in the fighting. Government forces effectively severed the oppositions main supply route on July 7 when they advanced to within firing range of the Castello Road. They have since tightened the encirclement of the rebel-held east taking parts of the road itself and causing food shortages and spiralling prices in opposition neighbourhoods. Syrias Al Watan daily which is close to the government also reported advances in Leramun an industrial area that once housed scores of factories. State news agency SANA broadcast a call from the military urging residents of eastern Aleppo to \"join the national reconciliation and expel the foreign mercenaries\" from their neighbourhoods. It said the army had sent text messages to residents and fighters in the east urging rebels to lay down their weapons and identifying safe passages for civilians wishing to leave. Government forces continued to pound opposition areas on Tuesday with the observatory reporting a new barrel bomb attack on the district of Al Mashhad. It said five civilians including three children were killed. On Monday at least 24 people including five children and two women were killed in a barrel bomb attack on the same neighbourhood according to a new toll from the observatory. A statement from the UN childrens agency UNICEF on Tuesday condemned weekend air raids on four hospitals in Aleppo calling them a blatant violation of international humanitarian law that may amount to war crimes. On the humanitarian front a 48-truck aid convoy on Tuesday entered regime-besieged Talbiseh in Homs province with food and other supplies for 40000 people the International Committee of the Red Cross said. More than 280000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests that were met with a regime crackdown.\n",

      "Original article:  Mon Jul 18 2016 21 Civilians Killed in US-Led Coalition Attacks in Northern Syria. Airstrikes by US-led coalition fighter jets have killed at least 21 civilians in northern Syrian territories held by the Daesh (ISIS ISIL) Takfiri terrorists a monitoring group says. The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Monday that at least 15 people were killed as the coalition carried out raids in a northern district of Manbij city. The UK-based group which advocates the Syrian opposition said six more people lost their lives in a village near Manbij after similar attacks by coalition fighter jets. The so-called multinational task force against ISIS started its controversial mission in Iraq in late 2014 after ISIS seized control over territories west and north of the country. The air campaign was later expanded to cover areas in northern Syria despite criticism from the Syrian government that the attacks violate the sovereignty of the Arab country. The United States claims the attacks are carried out to assist Syrian Kurds and Arabs fighting against ISIS in areas along the Turkish border in the province of Aleppo. However the attacks have led to numerous deaths among the civilians and Syrian military forces. The coalition attacks on Manbij intensified in late June after Kurds and Arabs from the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance failed in their drive to fully push back militants from the city. The SDF has attempted several times to advance from the western neighborhoods it has captured into the road south of Manbij which connects the strategic city to Raqqa the de facto capital of ISIS in Syria. Thousands have fled the fierce fighting in Manbij while tens of thousands more remain trapped in the city.

The air campaign was later expanded to cover areas in northern Syria despite criticism from the Syrian government that the attacks violate the sovereignty of the Arab country. The United States claims the attacks are carried out to assist Syrian Kurds and Arabs fighting against ISIS in areas along the Turkish border in the province of Idlib. However the attacks have led to numerous deaths among the civilians and Syrian military forces. The coalition attacks on Aleppo intensified in late June after Kurds and Arabs from the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance failed in their drive to fully push back militants from the city. The SDF has attempted several times to advance from the western neighborhoods it has captured into the road south of Aleppo which connects the strategic city to Raqqa the de facto capital of ISIS in Syria. Thousands have fled the fierce fighting in Aleppo while tens of thousands more remain trapped in the city. The US and allies use the Incirlik air base in southern Turkey to bomb purported ISIS positions in northern Syria and Iraq Press TV reported. SSH 11\n",

In a breaking news alert, state television said 100 people had also been injured in the blasts in the Al-Zahraa neighborhood of the city, which has been targeted in bomb attacks multiple times before. The provincial governor of Homs, Talal Barazi, told AFP that the two bombers appeared to have pulled up at the army checkpoint in a car together with one exiting the vehicle before the other detonated his explosives while still inside. In the chaos of the first blasts' aftermath and as a crowd gathered, the second bomber detonated his explosives, Barazi said. The Al-Zahraa district of Homs has been targeted in multiple bomb attacks in the past, including in late December when 19 people were killed in several simultaneous blasts.\n",

Russian military jets are seen at Hmeymim air base in Syria June 18 2016 (TRT World and Agencies) The death toll from Russian and Syrian strikes in the opposition-held city of Al Quriyah has risen to 82 people including 58 civilians the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Sunday. \"Three Russian and Syrian regime air raids on the region of Al-Quriyah southeast of Deir Ezzor city killed 58 civilians\" the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The rights group added that 24 other people were killed without specifying whether they were civilians or DAESH fighters. DAESH holds around 60 percent of Deir Ezzor city the capital of the province of the same name which is next to the jihadist-held Raqqa province. Government forces were also fighting rebels in northern neighbourhoods of the city in a bid to halt rocket fire on government-held districts. Elsewhere in Syria in Manbij US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) overran a key road junction in the citys south after capturing nearby grain silos overnight. Manbij lies in the eastern plains of Aleppo province which has become a battleground between an array of competing armed groups including Al-Qaeda non-jihadist rebels and government forces as well as the SDF and DAESH. Members of Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) attend the funeral of eight fellow fighters who died during an assault against the Islamic State (IS) group in the town of Manbij on June 24 2016. (AFP) The Raqa Revolutionaries Brigades - one of the Arab components of the Kurdish-dominated alliance - also said the SDF had seized the silos and pushed into the city. In 2014 DAESH took control of Manbij it was a key transit point for foreign fighters and funds as well as a trafficking hub for oil antiquities and other plundered goods. The SDF launched its offensive to take Manbij on May 31 driving across the Euphrates River from the east with military advice from some 200 US special forces troops. According to the Observatory DAESH has lost 463 fighters in the battle and the SDF has lost at least 89. A two-day freeze on fighting brokered by Moscow and Washington this month expired without renewal.

      "Original article:  Friday 19 Aug 2016 Syria regime pounds Kurdish positions for second day AFP Syrian regime warplanes bombarded the northeastern city of Hasakeh for the second day on Friday targeting positions held by Kurdish forces a monitor and a journalist in the city said. Fresh strikes came as the Pentagon said that US-led coalition fighter jets scrambled to protect Kurdish forces working with American advisers in Syria as they were targeted by regime planes Thursday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights - which monitors the conflict and determines which planes carry out raids according to their type location flight patterns and the munitions involved - said Fridays strikes were conducted by regime jets. The journalist in Hasakeh said eight air strikes could be heard throughout the day mostly focused in the citys southwestern neighbourhoods. Most of Hasakeh city the capital of the northeastern province by the same name is controlled by Kurdish forces while the rest is held by fighters loyal to President Bashar al-Assad. Since Wednesday clashes between the two forces have rocked the city leaving 23 civilians - including nine children - and 16 combattants dead the Observatory said. The Britain-based monitor said thousands of inhabitants had begun to flee Hasakeh where bread was running out and electricity supplies have been cut. Thursdays government raids on Hasakeh were the first time the regime had bombarded Kurdish positions from the air. The development prompted jets from the US-led coalition battling the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq to intervene in order to protect Kurdish forces working alongside US advisors a Pentagon spokesman said Friday. \"This was done as a measure to protect coalition forces\" Captain Jeff Davis said. \"We did make clear that US aircraft would defend troops on the ground if threatened.\" The Kurdish Peoples Protection Units (YPG) are a key US ally in the fight against IS. Washington regards them as the most effective fighting force on the ground in Syria and has provided weapons and special forces military advisers. IS controls most of the Euphrates valley to the south of Hasakeh and tensions between regime and Kurdish forces have sometimes led to armed clashes in spite of their common jihadist enemy. The Kurds who control much of northeastern and northern Syria along the Turkish border where they have proclaimed an autonomous Kurdish region recently demanded that the pro-government National Defence Forces disband in Hasakeh. A government source in the city told AFP that the air strikes were \"a message to the Kurds that they should stop this sort of demand that constitutes an affront to national sovereignty\". More than 290000 people have been killed since Syrias conflict erupted in March 2011.\n",

Several villages held by Islamic State have been captured by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) a coalition of militias backed by the United States that includes a strong Kurdish contingent an organisation that monitors the war said on Monday. Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) fighters walk in Tal Samin village north of Raqqa city Syria November 19 2016. REUTERS/Rodi Said The advance is part of a military campaign backed by an international coalition led by the United States to drive Islamic State from its Syrian capital of Raqqa. It follows SDF gains against the jihadist group across the north of the country. The strongest group in the SDF is the Peoples Protection Units or YPG a Kurdish militia but Washington has said that any operation to retake Raqqa should be predominantly Arab the ethnicity of most of the citys residents. The latest advances in the countryside about 50 km (30 miles) west and northwest of Raqqa follow an earlier phase of SDF gains on another front about 30 km north of the city. Three SDF soldiers were killed fighting Islamic State after the capture of five villages the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based war monitor said on Monday. Islamic State had been on the back foot in both Syria and Iraq where it is under attack in Mosul its biggest and most important possession and after a string of U.S. air strikes that have killed many of its leaders this year. However earlier this month it launched a surprise attack 160 km southwest of Raqqa to retake the ancient desert city of Palmyra which it had lost in March to Syrian army forces backed by Russian air power after a nine-month occupation. That attack demonstrated the risks still posed by the group across Syria even after its territorial losses there since mid-2015 including holdings along the Turkish border which were once its main route for supplies and recruits. Complicating the efforts against Islamic State is a second campaign being waged against it in northwest Syria by Turkey and Syrian rebel groups allied to Ankara. This has taken a large area from the jihadist group but is also aimed at stopping Kurdish expansion. The Turkish-backed Syrian rebels are now attempting to capture the city of al-Bab from Islamic State a move that will end Kurdish hopes of uniting their two separated areas of self rule in northern Syria. Early on Monday the Turkish military said one of its soldiers had been killed in a car bomb in al-Bab on Sunday and that 11 militants were also killed in clashes that day.

      "Original article:  2 medics among 31 dead in Syria army reprisal for slain pilot AFP Saturday 2 Jul 2016 Syrian government shelling of a rebel-held town killed 31 people including two medics on Saturday as a two-year local truce broke down after suspected Al-Qaeda militants killed a captured regime pilot. The bombardment struck the town of Jayrud 60 kilometres (35 miles) northeast of Damascus where the army says Islamist rebels killed the pilot after he was forced to eject on Friday. In its statement about the incident the military said the attack \"will not go unpunished.\" The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Saturdays attack was the first bombardment of the town in at least two years. \"Prominent figures in Jayrud have had a local truce with the regime for at least two years and neither fired on each other\" Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP. He said at least 31 people were killed including two medics. It was not immediately clear how many of the rest were civilians. Activists in the town said the head of the local medical centre and several colleagues were killed. \"There have been at least 45 air strikes today. The towns medical centre was hit and its director Amjad al-Danaf was killed\" activist Abu Malek al-Jayrudi told AFP via the Internet. He said the town is home to some 60000 people and that the bombardment had not stopped since early Saturday. Rebel groups in Jayrud include the Saudi-backed Jaish al-Islam (Army of Islam) the hardline Ahrar al-Sham and Al-Qaeda affiliate Al-Nusra Front. Jaish al-Islam spokesman Islam Alloush said on Friday that Al-Nusra Front had executed the air force pilot. Several government aircraft have been shot down by rebels or crashed because of technical faults since the civil war erupted five years ago. According to the Observatory three Syrian officers were killed on Friday when their helicopter crashed in the south near territory held by the Islamic State jihadist group. Abdel Rahman said government forces had managed to recover the bodies of the victims of the crash the cause of which remained unclear. \"We dont know if it was a technical issue or not but the bodies are with the regime\" Abdel Rahman said. Dozens of local truces have been brokered between the myriad of armed groups fighting in Syrias increasingly complex civil war. But a nationwide ceasefire between government forces and non-jihadist rebels brokered by Moscow and Washington in February has been repeatedly violated by both sides. US officials have accused Russia of not doing enough to rein in its ally President Bashar al-Assad. Moscow has countered that rebel groups that have failed to break ranks with Al-Qaeda and continue to fight alongside it are legitimate targets. The civil war which began with peaceful protests in 2011 has killed more than 280000 people and driven millions from their homes.\n",

      "Original article:  Date of publication 19 September 2016 Airstrikes in Aleppo province killed at least 22 Red Crescent [SARC] volunteers Monday including a senior official as well a number of civilians local sources said. Tags Syria Assad US Russia ceasefire Aleppo Suspected Syrian regime and Russian airstrikes in Aleppo province killed at least 22 Red Crescent [SARC] volunteers including a senior official as well as killing and injuring a number of civilians local sources said late on Monday. The strikes also damaged trucks carrying supplies. The attack was later confirmed by the UN. The renewed regime bombardment of rebel-held parts of Aleppo broken earlier by The New Arab and described by sources as relentless follows the collapse of a fragile ceasefire in place since Monday. \"Russian warplanes targeted an international aid convoy escorted by SARC killing 22 volunteers\" local activist Mohammad al-Halabi told The New Arab. Halabi confirmed the dead included SARCs chief in Aleppo province. According to Reuters the aid convoy was struck while traveling to Orem in Aleppo governorate. The agency quoted a United Nations spokesman late on Monday. The spokesman could not confirm if it was an airstrike. Syrian or Russian warplanes bombed aid trucks near Aleppo late on Monday after a fragile week-long ceasefire ended the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights also reported. The aid convoy of at least ten trucks was believed to have been carrying tonnes of much-needed humanitarian supplies and food from the UN. Reports suggest the aircraft doubled back after attacking the convoy and targeted rescue workers arriving on the scene. \t \tSyrias army announces the end of the freeze on fighting that began at 7pm (1600 GMT) on September 12 2016 in accordance with the US-Russia agreement\t \t Regime renews onslaught Elsewhere airstrikes have targeted at least five neighbourhoods in the rebel-held east of Aleppo city after the Syrian regime declared the end of the ceasefire. The bombing on Monday evening has trapped civilians in destroyed buildings and the \"White Helmets\" civil defence volunteers are searching for survivors under the rubble a resident told The New Arab. Artillery shelling was also reported to the south of the city. The freeze on fighting brokered by the United States and Russia lasted a week. Syrias armed forces on Monday blamed rebel groups for its failure. \"Syrias army announces the end of the freeze on fighting that began at 7pm (1600 GMT) on September 12 2016 in accordance with the US-Russia agreement\" the statement carried by state news agency SANA said. It said rebel groups \"did not commit to a single element\" of the deal. A contributor to The New Arab based in Aleppo reported at least five regime air raids in the space of ten minutes at around 800pm not long after the end of the ceasefire was announced. The truce had come into force on the evening of September 12. The main battlefronts subsequently saw a marked reduction in violence but clashes broke out late last week in the central provinces of Hama and Homs as well as east of Damascus. The deal was further strained by US-led coalition strikes on Syrian army positions in the east that killed dozens of government soldiers which Washington said was not intentional. On Sunday the cessation of hostilities was hanging by a thread after a fresh wave of air raids hit rebel-held districts of the battleground city of Aleppo killing one woman. These images sent from east Aleppo earlier on Monday by journalist Zouhir al-Shimale show eerily deserted streets as the Syrian armed forces declared the end of the ceasefire. Zouhir told The New Arab that residents who have been under regime siege despite the ceasefire see \"no clear vision for the near future in the city\". Just two hours later the bombing began again in earnest. Agencies contributed Read Also\n",

On Tuesday an alleged chemical weapon attack in Syria's Idlib province claimed the lives of some 80 people and inflicted harm on an additional 200 civilians. The Syrian National Coalition of Revolutionary and Opposition Forces that reported the attack as well as a number of Western states blamed the Syrian government troops for the attack while Damascus has refuted these allegations with a Syrian army source telling Sputnik that the army did not possess shelling capabilities. ... 38 Topic US Missile Attack on Syrian Air Base (200) Tags strike Syria United States Homs Community standardsDiscussion Comment via FacebookComment via Sputnik News\n",

      "Original article:  Thursday 18 May 2017 ISIS kills more than 50 in central Syria attack. The ISIS group killed more than 50 people in an attack on two government-held villages in central Syrias Hama province on Thursday a monitor said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the attack on two villages killed 15 civilians and 27 pro-government fighters with another 10 bodies yet to be identified as government fighters or local residents. ISIS also lost 15 fighters in the attack the monitor said. Thursdays attack comes as government forces are on the offensive against the extremists in other parts of Syria. Syrias state news agency SANA said troops and pro-government gunmen repelled the ISIS attack on villages in Hama province. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said ISIS captured several army positions in the area and killed nine troops. It said troops launched a counteroffensive under the cover of airstrikes. State TV said two people were wounded in ISIS shelling on the nearby town of Salamiyeh. The ISIS-linked Aamaq news agency confirmed an attack is ongoing in the area without giving details.\n",

      "Original article:  Bombing of Syrian bus convoy kills wounds dozens outside Aleppo A bomb blast hit a bus convoy waiting to cross into government-held Aleppo in Syria on Saturday killing and wounding dozens of people evacuated from two Shia villages the day before in a deal between warring sides. The agreement had stalled leaving thousands of people from both government-besieged and rebel-besieged areas stranded at two transit points on the citys outskirts before the explosion occurred. Pro-Damascus media outlets said a suicide attacker detonated a car bomb and killed at least 22 people. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the death toll was at least 24. Footage on state TV showed bodies lying next to charred buses with their windows blown out and vehicles in flames. The blast hit buses in the Rashidin area on Aleppos outskirts. The vehicles had been waiting since Friday to cross from rebel-held territory into the government-controlled city itself. The convoy was carrying residents and pro-government fighters from the rebel-besieged Shia villages of al-Foua and Kefraya in nearby Idlib province. They had left under a deal where in exchange hundreds of Sunni insurgents and their families were granted safe passage from Madaya a government-besieged town near Damascus. But a delay in the agreement had left all those evacuated stuck at transit points on Aleppos outskirts since late on Friday. Residents of al-Foua and Kefraya were waiting in the Rashidin area. The rebels and residents of Madaya near Damascus were waiting at the government-held Ramousah bus garage a few miles away. They were to be transported to the opposition stronghold of Idlib province. People waiting in the Ramousah garage heard the blast and said they feared revenge attacks by pro-government forces. They circulated a statement on social media imploring \"international organizations\" to intervene so the situation did not escalate. The evacuation deal is one of several over recent months that has seen President Bashar al-Assads government take back control of areas long besieged by his forces and their allies. The deals are unpopular with the Syrian opposition who say they amount to forced displacement of Assads opponents from Syrias main urban centers in the west of the country. They are also causing demographic changes because those who are displaced are usually Sunni Muslims like most of the opposition. Assad is from the minority Alawite sect and is supported by Shia regional allies. It was unclear who carried out Saturdays bombing attack. The exact reasons for the delay in completing the evacuation deal were also unclear. The Observatory said the delay was caused by the fact that rebels from Zabadani another town near Damascus included in the deal had not yet been granted safe passage out. FORCED DISPLACEMENT A pro-opposition activist said insurgents blamed the delay partly on the fact that a smaller number of pro-government fighters had left the Shia villages than was agreed. Earlier on Saturday at the transit point where the buses from al-Foua and Kefraya were waiting one resident said he was not yet sure where he would live. \"After Aleppo Ill see what the rest of the group is doing if there are any preparations. My house land and belongings are all in al-Foua\" Mehdi Tahhan said. A Madaya resident speaking from the bus garage inside Aleppo said people had been waiting there since late on Friday and were not being allowed to leave. \"Theres no drinking water or food. The bus garage is small so theres not much space to move around\" Ahmed 24 said. \"Were sad and angry about what has happened\" he said. Many people felt that they had been forced to leave\" he said. \"There was no other choice in the end - we were besieged inside a small area in Madaya.\" Other evacuation deals in recent months have included areas of Aleppo and a district in the city of Homs. Syrias population is mostly Sunni. Assads Alawite religious minority is often considered an offshoot of Shia Islam. He has been backed militarily by Russia and by Shia fighters from Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah group in Syrias six-year-old conflict. Assad has the military advantage over rebels in the west thanks to Russias intervention in 2015 although the insurgents are still fighting back and have made gains in some areas.\n",

      "Original article:  Date of publication 5 July 2016 The bomber was on a motorcycle when he attacked a crowd outside a bakery. \"A suicide bomber on a motorcycle blew himself up in the Salihiah neighbourhood of Hasakah city\" said Rami Abdel Rahman head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights adding that 15 of the wounded were in critical condition. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack which it claimed targeted Kurdish forces. Kurdish police put the death toll at 16 earlier. Nearly all of Hasakah province is controlled by the Kurdish Peoples Protection Units (YPG) who have declared an autonomous region across the mainly Kurdish northern areas they hold. The YPG is regarded by the Pentagon as the most effective fighting force against IS on the ground in Syria. Meanwhile fighting between Islamic State militants and a Kurdish-Arab alliance troops has forced 13000 residents to flee the IS-bastion city of Manbij. \"The fleeing increased after the Syrian Democratic Force [SDF] besieged Manbij\" on June 10 the head of the Syrian Observatory said. \"Hundreds of people fled a southern district of the town where there have been fierce clashes in recent days\". The US-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance seized a key road junction and grain silos overlooking the city last week pushing further into the Islamic State group stronghold. The city lies close to the border with Turkey and is a key staging post on the extremists supply line to areas under its control in eastern Syria and neighbouring Iraq. The militants took an estimated 900 Kurdish civilians hostage in areas under their control west of the city according to the Observatory and Kurdish officials. Manbij lies in the eastern plains of Aleppo province which has become a battleground between an array of competing armed groups including al-Qaeda rebels and government forces as well as the SDF and the IS group.
