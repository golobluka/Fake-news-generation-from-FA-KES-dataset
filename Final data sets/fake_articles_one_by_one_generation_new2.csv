270,,,10 October 2017 Russian Defense Ministry: More than 100 ISIS terrorists killed in Deir Ezzor. Russian Defense Ministry said that US-led coalition has sharply reduced the intensity of its attacks on ISIS terrorists positions in Iraq following the beginning of military operations of the Syrian Arab Army to liberate Deir Ezzor. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said on Tuesday that The continuing supply of terrorists from Iraq raises serious questions about the objectives of operations against terrorists conducted in the region by aircraft of the United States and the so-called international coalition adding that in the western part of Iraq ISIS-controlled territory continues to increase. Konashenkov affirmed that the actions of the coalition require clarification. Does such a shift in the US and the coalitions priorities mean the desire to complicate the operation conducted by the Syrian army supported by Russias Aerospace Forces to liberate Syrias territory east of the Euphrates? Or is it a possibility to liberate Iraq from ISIS terrorists driving them into Syria under the precise airstrikes of the Russian Aerospace Forces? he questioned. Russias Aerospace Forces carry out up to 150 strikes per day on ISIS terrorists positions near al- Mayadin city in Deir Ezzor supporting the expand military operation of the Syrian army to liberate the city the largest ISIS positions in Deir Ezzor. Konashenkov said that over the past 24 hours Russias aerospace group dealt 182 strikes against the positions of ISIS terrorists who had infiltrated to Deir Ezzor province from Iraq. Two pairs of Sukhoi-34 bombers were commissioned to hit the targets. Fourteen consecutive strikes were made Konashenkov added. Objective monitoring means confirmed the destruction of four tanks three armored personnel carriers and nine off-road vehicles armed with heavy machineguns and two multiple rocket launchers. Fifty terrorists were killed and another 30 sealed off in the underground tunnels Konashenkov said. Forty minutes later a Sukhoi-34 bomber carried out another attack against this stronghold to kill another 20 terrorists who had arrived for evacuating those injured he added. The Russian Aerospace Forces have destroyed the economic infrastructure of ISIS in Syria and foiled any attempts by terrorists to resume the production and illegal sale of hydrocarbons in Syria. ISIS no longer has the sources of financing for purchasing weapons and ammunition and recruiting mercenaries in Syria he said. Konashenkov added a command center of ISIS and three groups of terrorists who had arrived from Iraq had been destroyed near Hatla town. The elimination of 34 terrorists five off-road vehicles carrying large caliber weapons and two trucks full of ammunition has been confirmed he said.

State-run Syrian TV said troops entered the town of Zabadani from the western Jamaiyat district Sunday.

25,,,"29 Jul 2016 The US-led coalition strikes came a day after the coalition opened a formal investigation to determine whether its air strikes last week near Manbij claimed more than 100 civilians including children. A picture taken on July 29 2016 shows a close up view of Karaj al-Hajz corridor (C) a passage in rebel-held Aleppo leading towards the Syrian government controlled area of Masharqa neighbourhood. (TRT World and Agencies) At least 15 civilians were killed and many wounded in fresh air strikes by US-led coalition in Syria on Thursday morning. These civilians were targeted in the coalition jets bombardment in the town of Ghandoura said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. US Central Command which oversees US military operations in the Middle East said it had ""initiated an assessment following internal operational reporting that a strike today near Manbij Syria may have resulted in civilian casualties."" The strikes came a day after the coalition opened a formal investigation to determine whether its air strikes last week near Manbij claimed more than 100 civilian lives including children. US-led coalition continue to target civilians in Syria (Reuters) Around 600 Syrians including 136 children have been killed in coalition air strikes since September 2014 according to an Observatory toll. More than 520 US airstrikes since 21 May have killed between 229 and 425 civilians overall. After examining ""internal and external information"" the coalition determined that there was sufficient credible evidence of civilian victims to open a formal inquiry said spokesman Colonel Chris Garver on Wednesday. The main Syrian opposition group had urged the US-led coalition to suspend its bombardments following the strikes. Amnesty International has also called on the coalition to redouble its efforts to prevent civilian deaths and to investigate possible violations of international humanitarian law.
