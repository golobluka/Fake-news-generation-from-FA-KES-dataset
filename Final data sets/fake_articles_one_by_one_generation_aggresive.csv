The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitor said the blast hit a checkpoint under the control of the YPG. Hasakeh city has been regularly targeted by DAESH including in July when a bomber on a motorcycle killed at least 16 people outside a bakery in the city. The terrorist group has been losing ground to the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces which is mainly comprised of the YPG even though its affiliate organisation the PKK is listed as a terrorist organisation by Turkey the US and the EU. More recently DAESH has also lost territory to Turkish-backed Free Syria Army (FSA) fighters. Over the weekend advances by the Turkish Army and Free Syria Army (FSA) fighters expelled DAESH from the last stretch of the Syrian-Turkish border under their control. (TRT World and Agencies) Turkish Armed Forces launched Operation Euphrates Shield on August 24 to protect its borders and secure the Turkish town of Karkamis adjoining Syria from DAESH attacks. Simultaneous attacks In central Homs city regime media said at least three people were killed in a car bomb at the entrance to the Al-Zahraa neighbourhood whose residents mostly belong to the same Alawite sect as Assad. Al-Zahraa has also been regularly targeted in bomb attacks including a devastating double bomb blast in February that killed 57 people and was claimed by DAESH.

Another bomb attack was also reported on the Al-Sabura road west of the capital Damascus with regime media saying one person had been killed and three injured in that bombing. The Observatory said that the attack targeted a checkpoint and gave a death toll of three. Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said the blasts appeared to be coordinated. ""Clearly these attacks were simultaneous and they all targeted security posts"" he told AFP. More than 290000 people have been killed in Syria since the war started and millions have been displaced by the fighting. Successive rounds of international negotiations aimed at finding a political solution have failed to bear fruit but US Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov are due to resume discussions on stemming the violence on Monday.

""As well as the 10 civilians killed in strikes on the bus... 21 others died in intense strikes on several neighbourhoods in the east of the city since dawn"" the organisation known as the White Helmets said. An AFP correspondent in Aleppo said Fridays bombing raids were the most intense in more than a week with dozens of barrel bombs - crude unguided explosive devices - hitting several eastern quarters of the city. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported intense strikes on the Castello road - a key rebel supply route out of divided Aleppo - giving a toll of eight dead civilians. A bus on the road was also hit on Wednesday resulting in seven civilian deaths. Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said the Castello road which for civilians in rebel-held areas is the route out of Aleppo was now ""effectively cut"". ""All movement is targeted be that buses or bystanders"" he said. Abdel Rahman said rocket fire on government-held areas of the city overnight caused several casualties but he was unable to provide an exact toll. A truce agreed by Russia and the United States in February has been violated nearly continuously around Aleppo where the regime and rebel groups have fought for control since 2012. More than 300 civilians have been killed in Aleppo since April as rebels have pounded government-controlled neighbourhoods with rocket and artillery fire and the regime has hit rebel areas with air raids. At least 280000 people have been killed and millions displaced since Syrias war started in 2011 with the brutal repression of anti-government protests.","{'Name of casualty or group': '31 civilians', 'Gender or age group': 'civilians (adults)', 'Cause of death': 'regime bombing raids, airstrikes', 'Type': 'Syrian regime', 'Actor': 'Syrian regime', 'Place of death': 'Aleppo', 'Date of death': 'Friday 3 Jun 2016 (no specific date mentioned)'}",date of death,cause of death

Tags Syria Aleppo Azaz Rebels Car Bomb Islamic State At least 20 people were killed in a car bomb blast at an opposition checkpoint in the northern Syrian province of Aleppo on Thursday local sources said. The blast hit near the town of Azaz close to the border with Turkey local activist Mohammad al-Halabi told The New Arab adding that rebels manning the checkpoint and civilians waiting to get through were killed. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 14 of the dead were rebels. The attack also injured dozens and the monitor said the toll could rise further because of the number of people with serious wounds. The checkpoint was run by the Shamiya Front rebel group which is active in Aleppo province and was on the road to the Bab al-Salama crossing. The blast caused huge devastation and most of the injured were taken across the border to the nearby Turkish hospitals Mohammad al-Halabi added. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack which al-Halabi believes bares the hallmarks of the Islamic State group. IS has regularly targeted rebel factions with bomb attacks including an October 6 attack at a border crossing in neighbouring Idlib province that killed 29 rebels.

285,,,Tuesday 4 April 2017 Assad regime responsible for awful Syria chemical attack: EUs Mogherini . EU diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini said Tuesday the regime of Bashar al-Assad bears primary responsibility for a suspected chemical attack that killed at least 58 people in a rebel-held town in Idlib Syria including 11 children under the age of eight on Tuesday. Today the news is awful Mogherini said in an interview with media organisations in Brussels on the sidelines of a EU-UN conference that was meant to focus on the post-conflict situation in Syria. A Syrian military source strongly denied the army had used any such weapons. The attack caused many people to choke or faint and some had foam coming out of their mouths the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said citing medical sources who described it as a sign of a gas attack. The air strikes on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the south of rebel-held Idlib also wounded more than 60 people said the Observatory a British-based war-monitoring group. This morning at 6:30 a.m. warplanes targeted Khan Sheikhoun with gases believed to be sarin and chlorine said Mounzer Khalil head of Idlibs health authority adding that the attack had killed more than 50 people and wounded 300. Most of the hospitals in Idlib province are now overflowing with wounded people he told a news conference in Idlib. Warplanes later struck near a medical point where victims of the attack were being treated the Observatory said and civil defence workers said. The civil defence also known as the White Helmets - a rescue service that operates in opposition areas of Syria - said jets struck one of its centres in the area and the nearby medical point. It would mark the deadliest chemical attack in Syria since sarin gas killed hundreds of civilians in Ghouta near Damascus in August 2013. Western states said the Syrian government was responsible for that attack. Damascus blamed it on rebels. Military denies The Syrian military source on Tuesday denied allegations that government forces had used chemical weapons dismissing the accounts as rebel propaganda. The army has not and does not use them not in the past and not in the future because it does not have them in the first place the source said. A joint inquiry for the United Nations and the global chemical weapons watchdog has previously accused government forces of toxic gas attacks. France called for an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting about Tuesdays suspected attack. Reuters photographs showed people breathing through oxygen masks and wearing protection suits while others carried the bodies of dead children and corpses wrapped in blankets were lined up on the ground. Activists in northern Syria circulated pictures on social media showing a purported victim with foam around his mouth and rescue workers hosing down almost naked children squirming on the floor. Most of the towns streets had become empty a witness said. The conflict pits President Bashar al-Assads government helped by Russia and Iranian-backed militias against a wide array of rebel groups including some that have been supported by Turkey the United States and Gulf monarchies. The Russian Defence Ministry said on Tuesday that Russian planes had not carried out air strikes on Idlib. Syrian and Russian air strikes have battered parts of Idlib despite a ceasefire that Turkey and Russia brokered in December according to the Observatory. Turkish President Tay yip Eroding and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the suspected attack Turkish presidential sources said. They said the two leaders had also emphasised the importance of maintaining the ceasefire. Population ballooned Idlib province contains the largest populated area controlled by the anti-Assad rebels - both nationalist Free Syrian Army groups and Islamist factions including the former al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front. Idlibs population has ballooned with thousands of fighters and civilians shuttled out of Aleppo city and areas around Damascus that the government has retaken in recent months. US air strikes since January have also hit several areas in the rural province where militias have a powerful presence. The United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have been investigating whether Damascus is adhering to its commitments under the 2013 agreement which averted the threat of US-led military intervention. In a report in October last year the inquiry said that government forces used chemical weapons at least three times in 2014-2015 and that ISIS used mustard gas in 2015. Following the 2013 Ghouta attack the Syrian government joined the international Chemical Weapons Convention under a US-Russian deal. The government which denied its forces were behind the Ghouta attack also agreed to hand over its declared stockpile of 1300 tonnes of toxic weaponry and dismantle its chemical weapons program under international supervision. Damascus has repeatedly denied using such weapons during the six-year war which has killed hundreds of thousands and created the worlds worst refugee crisis.,"{'Name of casualty or group': 'civilians, including 11 children under the age of eight', 'Gender or age group': 'children (under 8), civilians', 'Cause of death': 'sarin and chlorine gas attack', 'Type': 'civilian', 'Actor': 'Syrian regime, Bashar al-Assad', 'Place of death': 'Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province', 'Date of death': 'Tuesday (no specific date mentioned)'}",actor,cause of death

79,,,"Dozens of children dead in Syria evacuees bombing Nearly 70 children were among those killed when a suicide car bombing tore through buses carrying evacuees from besieged government-held towns in Syria a monitor said on Sunday. Saturdays blast hit a convoy carrying residents from the northern towns of Fuaa and Kafraya as they waited at a transit point in rebel-held Rashidin west of Aleppo. At least 68 children were among the 126 people killed in the attack the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said updating a previous toll of 112 dead. At least 109 of the dead were evacuees the Britain-based monitoring group said while the rest were aid workers and rebels guarding the convoy. The evacuations were taking place under a deal between Syrias regime and rebels that is also seeing residents and rebels transported out of Madaya and Zabadani towns near Damascus which are surrounded by pro-government forces. The agreement is the latest in a string of evacuation deals which the government of President Bashar al-Assad says are the best way to end the violence after more than six years of civil war. Rebels say they amount to forced relocations after years of bombardment and crippling sieges. Body parts and the belongings of evacuees - including clothes dishes and even televisions - were still strewn at the scene of the attack on Sunday an AFP correspondent said. The shattered buses were nearby as was the shell of a pick-up truck - with little left but its engine block - that was apparently used to carry out the bombing. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing though the key Ahrar al-Sham rebel group denied any involvement. The government blamed ""terrorists"" - a catch-all term for its opponents. The Observatory which relies on a network of sources inside Syria to monitor the conflict said hundreds of people were also wounded in the blast. It said a petrol station at the transit point was caught up in the explosion adding to the number of victims. The Syrian Red Crescent said three of its workers were among the wounded. Maysa al-Aswad a 30-year-old evacuee from Kafraya said she was sitting on one of the buses with her six-month-old son Hadi and 10-year-old daughter Narjis when the blast shook the parked convoy. ""Hadi was on my lap and Narjis on a chair next to me. When the explosion happened I hugged them both and we fell to the floor"" she told AFP by telephone from near Aleppo. ""I didnt know what was happening all I could hear was people crying and shouting"" she said. ""All I can think about is how we survived all the death during the last few years and then could have died just after we finally escaped."" More than 5000 people left Fuaa and Kafraya and about 2200 left Madaya and Zabadani on Friday the latest in a series of evacuations from the four towns under the agreement. The evacuation process resumed after the bombing the Observatory said with the residents of Fuaa and Kafraya eventually arriving in Aleppo Syrias second city which the government gained full control of last year. Wounded survivors including many children were taken for treatment at an Aleppo hospital. UN aid chief Stephen OBrien condemned the bombing saying in a statement ""The perpetrators of such a monstrous and cowardly attack displayed a shameless disregard for human life."" Pope Francis on Sunday also urged an end to the war in Syria as he presided over the traditional Easter mass in Rome. The pontiff said he hoped that Jesus Christs sacrifice might help bring ""comfort and relief to the civil population in Syria prey to a war that continues to sow horror and death"". The residents and rebels from Madaya and Zabadani arrived late Saturday in rebel-held territory in Idlib province where they were greeted with embraces and shots fired into the air. It was not immediately clear whether further evacuations were taking place on Sunday. The evacuation deal was brokered by Qatar a longtime supporter of Syrian opposition forces and Iran a key regime ally. Shiite-dominated Iran has repeatedly raised concerns for the residents of Fuaa and Kafraya who are mainly Shiites and were besieged by Sunni rebels. Syrias war has left more than 320000 people dead since erupting in 2011 with more than half the population forced from their homes and hundreds of thousands trapped under siege.","{'Name of casualty or group': 'Dozens of children, evacuees, aid workers, rebels', 'Gender or age group': 'children (0-18), adults (evacuees and aid workers)', 'Cause of death': 'suicide car bombing, explosion', 'Type': 'non-civilian (rebel guards) and civilian (evacuees and aid workers)', 'Actor': ""Syrian regime blamed 'terrorists' for the attack, but no specific group was mentioned"", 'Place of death': 'Rashidin, a transit point in rebel-held area west of Aleppo', 'Date of death': ""Not available (article mentions Saturday's blast, but does not specify date)""}",Place of death,actor

They were evacuated earlier this month under an unprecedented deal involving a major rebel coalition and Iran a strong backer of the regime. The end of the Old City siege brought it back under regime control leaving only the Waer district in northwest Homs in rebel hands.

Vice-president of the Syrian Coalition Abdul Ahad Steifo said that the ongoing brutal assault on Aleppo by the Assad regime Russia and the Iranian militias has so far failed to achieve its objectives to retake the entire city in spite of the genocidal crimes being committed against civilians. Aleppo has seen the gravest war crimes since World War II Steifo said adding that the regime Russia and Iran have not achieved their objectives in Aleppo. Russia is now seeking to get of the trouble it brought upon itself in Syria. Aleppo and its countryside have been subjected to ferocious onslaught by the Assad regime and Russian forces since November 15. Over 750 people mostly women and children have so far been killed and thousands more injured in the ongoing bombing campaign on the city and its countryside. Steifo stressed the urgent need for the resumption of the political process through negotiations in Geneva and the enforcement of UN resolutions especially the humanitarian provisions that call for an end to the bombing lifting the sieges the delivery of aid to civilians in need and the release of detainees.

A team of first responders the Syrian Civil Defence in Idlib said 22 people were killed and at least 50 injured in airstrikes that occurred in September 2015, likely carried out by ISIS forces. The attack targeted a village in Idlib province where children were attending school.

The cause of death was airstrikes. The victims included children, an adult woman, and adult males. They were civilians who lost their lives due to the actions of ISIS forces.

Separately, USA army-backed opposition fighters clashed with Kurdish-led forces in a village in northern Aleppo province on August 2014. Several people were killed or injured in the intense clashes that occurred between the two groups. The victims included adult males who died as a result of barrel bombs and helicopter attacks carried out by USA army forces.

The incident highlighted the ongoing conflict between different groups in Syria, including USA army-backed opposition fighters and Kurdish-led forces.","{'Name of casualty or group': 'Children,\\n Woman,\\n Turkish-backed opposition fighters,\\n Kurdish-led fighters', 'Gender or age group': 'children,\\n adult woman,\\n adult males,\\n adult males', 'Cause of death': 'airstrikes,\\n airstrikes,\\n barrel bombs, helicopter attack,\\n intense clashes with Turkish-backed opposition forces', 'Type': 'civilian,\\n civilian,\\n non-civilian,\\n non-civilian', 'Actor': 'ISIS,\\n ISIS,\\n USA army,\\n Turkish-backed opposition forces', 'Place of death': 'Village of Hass, Idlib province,\\n Village of Hass, Idlib province,\\n Village of Tal Madiq, northern Aleppo province,\\n Village of Tal Madiq, northern Aleppo province', 'Date of death': 'September 2015,\\n September 2015,\\n August 2014,\\n August 2014'}",Last updated at Oct 262016 BEIRUT Air strikes in Syria killed up to 22 people mostly children on Wednesday when warplanes struck a residential area housing a school complex in the northern rebel-held province of Idlib activists and rescue workers said. A team of first responders the Syrian Civil Defence in Idlib said 22 people were killed and at least 50 wounded in the raids on the village of Hass. Most of those killed were children the group said in a post on its Facebook page. Another activist group the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights gave the same death toll and said 14 children and a woman were among those killed. The activist-operated Idlib News network which gave a lower toll of 17 people killed said the strikes hit as the children were gathered outside the school complex. It said the death toll could rise as some of the wounded were reported to be in critical condition the network added. Idlib is the main Syrian opposition stronghold though radical groups also have a large presence there. It has regularly been hit by Syrian and Russian warplanes as well as the US-led coalition targeting Daesh militants. Footage posted by activists online shows a huge plume of smoke rising from the area of the strikes and rescuers rushing casualties away along a dusty road lined with destroyed buildings. A womans body is seen being carried on a stretcher while other bodies covered in cloth and one with only a hat lie under shrubs and other casualties are ferried away in pick-up trucks. An activist at the scene Muaz Al Shami said as many as 10 air strikes were believed to have hit the residential area. The video content couldnt be independently confirmed. However it conforms with AP reporting on the events depicted. Earlier in the day the northern Aleppo province saw a new escalation as a helicopter believed to belong to Syrian government forces dropped barrel bombs in a deadly attack on Turkey-backed opposition forces in the border area Turkish officials said. A statement attributed to the field commander of Syrias pro-government troops said any Turkish advances in northern Syria under the pretext of fighting Daesh militants would be dealt with forcefully and appropriately. The barrel bombing was said to have occurred in the village of Tal Madiq in a part of northern Aleppo where rival groups have been operating mostly to rout Daesh militants. If confirmed it would be the first attack by Syrian government forces on the Turkish-backed fighters. Turkeys state-run news agency didnt say when the attack occurred and said at least two Syrian opposition fighters were killed and five others wounded. A Syrian opposition spokesman said it took place Tuesday. The observatorys chief Rami Abdurrahman said helicopters struck as intense clashes were underway between Kurdish-led fighters and Turkey-backed forces in Tal Madiq and that 11 Syrian opposition fighters and five Kurdish fighters were killed. The Kurdish-led forces are now in control of the village about 16 kilometres from the highly prized Daesh-controlled town of Al Bab. A senior Kurdish commander however denied Syrian government bombings of the Turkey-backed fighters saying it was an attempted explanation for battlefield losses. They are trying to find a pretext for the loss. No aircraft were involved Mahmoud Barkhadan of the main Syria Kurdish militia the Peoples Protection Units told The Associated Press by telephone from the region. A spokesman for the Syrian fighting group Nour El Din El Zinki Yasser Al Youssef said the Kurdish-led forces attacked them while they were fighting Daesh militants in the area. Then Syrian government helicopters followed he said in a message. The complex terrain is a powder keg where confrontation among rival groups can break out anytime US-backed Syrian Kurdish fighters Turkey-backed Syrian rebels and Turkey. Ankara sent tanks troops and aircraft into northern Syria in August in an unprecedented incursion that it said was part of efforts to help Syrian opposition clear the border area of Daesh militants. But Ankara is also seeking to contain the US-backed Syrian Kurdish forces fighting Daesh putting it at odds with its key ally the United States. Ankara sees Kurdish fighters in Syria as an extension of its outlawed Kurdish militants and designated as a terrorist organisation. Syrias military threatened last week to shoot down any Turkish warplane that enters Syrian air space after Turkish jets raided villages in northern Syria in an escalation of Ankaras offensive against Kurdish fighters. On Wednesday a statement attributed to the field commander of pro-government troops said Turkish advance under the pretext of fighting Daesh in northern and eastern Aleppo is an encroachment on the Syrian governments area of operations and would not be tolerated. The fall of Al Bab to Turkey-backed rebels would threaten the governments siege on the rebels in the city of Aleppo to the west. Meanwhile Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters that Turkey is determined to push ahead with the offensive in northern Syria dubbed Operation Eurphrates Shield and capture Al Bab from Daesh militants. It would not be deterred by the bombing of Tal Madiq he said. Such attacks will not stop us from combatting Daesh Cavusoglu said. The Euphrates Shield operation will continue. The only goal of the Euphrates Shield operation is to clear Daesh from this area.,"{'Name of casualty or group': '\n    Children,\n    Woman,\n    Turkish-backed opposition fighters,\n    Kurdish-led fighters\n  ', 'Gender or age group': '\n    children,\n    adult woman,\n    adult males,\n    adult males\n  ', 'Cause of death': '\n    airstrikes,\n    airstrikes,\n    barrel bombs, helicopter attack,\n    intense clashes with Turkish-backed opposition forces\n  ', 'Type': '\n    civilian,\n    civilian,\n    non-civilian,\n    non-civilian\n  ', 'Actor': '\n    Syrian warplanes, likely Russian forces,\n    Syrian warplanes, likely Russian forces,\n    Syrian government forces,\n    Kurdish-led forces, Turkish-backed opposition forces\n  ', 'Place of death': '\n    Village of Hass, Idlib province,\n    Village of Hass, Idlib province,\n    Village of Tal Madiq, northern Aleppo province,\n    Village of Tal Madiq, northern Aleppo province\n  ', 'Date of death': '\n    Wednesday (no specific date mentioned),\n    Wednesday (no specific date mentioned),\n    Tuesday (no specific date mentioned),\n    Tuesday (no specific date mentioned)\n  '}",date of death,actor

Syrian activists accused President Bashar al-Assads forces of launching a nerve gas attack that killed at least 213 people on Wednesday in what would if confirmed be by far the worst reported use of poison gas in the two-year-old civil war. Reuters was not able to verify the accounts independently and they were denied by Syrian state television which said they were disseminated deliberately to distract a team of United Nations chemical weapons experts which arrived three days ago. The U.N. team is in Syria investigating allegations that both rebels and army forces used poison gas in the past one of the main disputes in international diplomacy over Syria. Activists said rockets with chemical agents hit the Damascus suburbs of Ain Tarma Zamalka and Jobar before dawn. A nurse at Douma Emergency Collection facility Bayan Baker said the death toll as collated from medical centers in the suburbs east of Damascus was 213. Many of the casualties are women and children. They arrived with their pupil dilated cold limbs and foam in their mouths. The doctors say these are typical symptoms of nerve gas victims the nurse said. Extensive amateur video and photographs purporting to show victims appeared on the Internet. A video purportedly shot in the Kafr Batna neighborhood showed a room filled with more than 90 bodies many of them children and a few women and elderly men. Most of the bodies appeared ashen or pale but with no visible injuries. About a dozen were wrapped in blankets. Other footage showed doctors treating people in makeshift clinics. One video showed the bodies of a dozen people lying on the floor of a clinic with no visible wounds. The narrator in the video said they were all members of a single family. In a corridor outside lay another five bodies. A photograph taken by activists in Douma showed the bodies of at least 16 children and three adults one wearing combat fatigues laid at the floor of a room in a medical facility where bodies were collected. Syrian state television quoted a source as saying there was no truth whatsoever to the reports. Syria is one of just a handful of countries that are not parties to the international treaty that bans chemical weapons and Western nations believe it has caches of undeclared mustard gas sarin and VX nerve agents. A youth affected by what activists say is nerve gas is treated at a hospital in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus August 21 2013. REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh Assads officials have said they would never use poison gas - if they had it - against Syrians. The United States and European allies believe Assads forces used small amounts of sarin gas in attacks in the past which Washington called a red line that justified international military aid for the rebels. Assads government has responded in the past with accusations that it was the rebels that used chemical weapons which the rebels deny. Western countries say they do not believe the rebels have access to poison gas. Assads main global ally Moscow says accusations on both sides must be investigated. Khaled Omar of the opposition Local Council in Ain Tarma said he saw at least 80 bodies at the Hajjah Hospital in Ain Tarma and at a makeshift clinic at Tatbiqiya School in the nearby district of Saqba. Slideshow (3 Images) The attack took place at around 3:00 a.m. (0000 GMT / 8:00 p.m. Tuesday EDT). Most of those killed were in their homes Omar said. SURPRISING TIMING The timing and location of the reported chemical weapons use - just three days after the team of U.N. chemical experts checked in to a Damascus hotel a few km (miles) to the east at the start of their mission - was surprising. Logically it would make little sense for the Syrian government to employ chemical agents at such a time particularly given the relatively close proximity of the targeted towns (to the U.N. team) said Charles Lister analysts at IHS Janes Terrorism and Insurgency Center. Nonetheless the Ghouta region (where the attacks were reported) is well known for its opposition leanings. Jabhat al-Nusra has had a long-time presence there and the region has borne the brunt of sustained military pressure for months now he said referring to a hardline Sunni Islamist rebel group allied to al Qaeda. While it is clearly impossible to confirm the chemical weapons claim it is clear from videos uploaded by reliable accounts that a large number of people have died. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitoring group said dozens of people were killed including children in fierce bombardment. It said Mouadamiya southwest of the capital came under the heaviest attack since the start of the two-year conflict. The Observatory called on the U.N. experts and international organizations to visit the affected areas to ensure aid could be delivered and to launch an investigation to determine who was responsible for the bombardment and hold them to account.

Tags Syria Islamic State activists murder video Palmyra The Islamic State group has released a new video purporting to show the killing of two Syrian activists in the militants stronghold of Raqqa allegedly for spying on the extremists. IS has killed hundreds of people since it declared an Islamic caliphate in June last year with the city of Raqqa as its de facto capital. The video which was posted Monday on an IS-linked Facebook page shows two young men in orange jumpsuits who say they filmed and photographed IS-held areas in Syria and sent footage to a person abroad. They identify themselves as 21-year-old Faysal Hussein Habibi and 20-year-old Bishr Abdul-Azim. They are then tied to a tree after which masked gunmen shell them with artillery rounds, causing fatal injuries. This follows the release of a video posted online on 4 July purportedly showing Islamic State fighters killing 25 Syrian soldiers in the historic town of Palmyra in central Syria. Scores of Syrian troops and state employees were killed in the days after Palmyra fell to IS. The video showed the soldiers being taken in pickup trucks from the towns notorious Tadmur prison to the amphitheatre. At the theatre they were shelled by artillery, causing fatal injuries. Hundreds of people were seen watching the killings. The video did not indicate when the killings took place. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said these shootings took place on 28 June 2014.

The capture of Palmyra has raised concern that the militants might try to destroy one of the Middle Easts most spectacular archaeological sites a well-preserved Roman-era city on the towns edge as they have destroyed other pre-Islamic ancient monuments elsewhere in Syria and Iraq. On 2 July IS said its militants had destroyed six archaeological pieces from Palmyra that were confiscated from a smuggler.

334,,,"Sun Apr 16 2017 Death toll in bomb attack on Syria evacuees rises to 112. Many residents of Fuaa and Kafraya lost their lives after terrorists attacked their buses. Afp - The death toll in a suicide car bomb attack on buses carrying Syrians evacuated from two besieged government-held towns has risen to at least 112 a monitoring group said Sunday. The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that 98 evacuees from the northern towns of Fuaa and Kafraya were killed when an explosives-laden vehicle hit their buses at a transit point west of Aleppo on Saturday. It said the remainder of the dead were aid workers and rebels tasked with guarding the buses. It warned the death toll may rise further as ""hundreds"" more were wounded in the blast. Dozens of buses carrying several thousand refugees had been stuck by the roadside in the rebel-held town of Rashidin after leaving Fuaa and Kafraya on Friday under a deal reached between the government and opposition groups. More than 30000 people are set for evacuation under the deal brokered by rebel backer Qatar and regime ally Iran. Fuaa and Kafraya have been under rebel siege for more than two years. As part of the deal several hundred people including armed rebels will be transported out of Madaya and Zabadani towns near Damascus which are surrounded by pro-government forces. Syrias six-year civil war has seen several similar deals which the government of President Bashar al-Assad says are the best way to end the violence. Rebels say they are being forced to relocate through bombardment and seige. The government blamed Saturdays attack on ""terrorists."" The blast puts the four-town evacuation deal brokered partly by rebel backer Qatar and government ally Iran in doubt. The Observatory said after the bombing that the evacuation process had resumed but it was not immediately clear on Sunday if convoys had restarted their journeys.","{'Name of casualty or group': 'Evacuees from Fuaa and Kafraya, aid workers, rebels', 'Gender or age group': 'mixed (evacuees), adults (aid workers, rebels)', 'Cause of death': 'suicide car bomb attack', 'Type': 'non-civilian (rebel guards) and civilian (evacuees)', 'Actor': 'terrorists (according to the government)', 'Place of death': 'west of Aleppo, transit point', 'Date of death': 'Saturday'}",actor,date of death

170,"Last updated at Oct 082017 MOSCOW Some 120 Daesh terror group extremists and 60 foreign mercenaries were killed in a series of Syrian Observatory for Human Rights-led operations in Syria over the past 24 hours, the defence ministry in Moscow said on Saturday. Puzzlingly, the ministry also said three senior Daesh commanders, including Omar Al Shishani, had been confirmed dead as a result of an earlier operation. Moscow reported Shishani's death despite the fact that the Pentagon said in 2016 the notorious fighter had been killed by American troops in Iraq. A command post of the terrorists and up to 80 [Daesh] fighters, including nine natives of the Northern Caucasus, were destroyed in the area of Mayadeen, the ministry said, adding that another 40 Daesh fighters were killed around the town of Albu Kamal. Mayadeen is one of Daesh's last bastions in Syria. In another operation, more than 60 foreign mercenaries from the former Soviet Union, Tunisia, and Egypt were killed in the Euphrates Valley south of Deir Ezzor. The ministry said large numbers of foreign mercenaries were coming into the Syrian border town of Albu Kamal from Iraq. It also said Syrian Observatory for Human Rights-led forces had killed senior Daesh commanders Omar Al Shishani, Alaa Al Din Al Shishani, and Salah Al Din Al Shishani, all natives of the Northern Caucasus, in a series of shootouts with Daesh fighters. Moscow reported their deaths after taking several days to confirm the results of an earlier shootout on the northern outskirts of Albu Kamal which destroyed a Daesh command post with more than 30 fighters, including the natives of the Northern Caucasus. Omar the Chechen The Pentagon announced in March 2016 that American forces had killed Shishani, one of the most notorious faces of Daesh known for his thick red beard. Shishani, whose nom de guerre means ""Omar the Chechen,"" came from the former Soviet state of Georgia's Pankisi Gorge region, which is populated mainly by ethnic Chechens. He fought as a Chechen rebel against Russian forces before joining the Georgian military in 2006 and fought Russian forces again in Georgia in 2008. He later resurfaced in northern Syria as the commander of a group of foreign fighters and became a senior leader within Daesh. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights was not immediately available for further comment. Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, disagreed with Moscow's report. Salah Al Din Al Shishani is still alive and is somewhere in the regions controlled by extremist groups in the west of Aleppo province. He is a famous commander and his extremist group is allied with the extremists of Al Nusra Front but only in their fight against the regime; he said. He has no links with Daesh The advances against Daesh in Deir Ezzor have resulted in a heavy civilian death toll through Syrian Observatory for Human Rights-led operations.

263,Tuesday 04 April 2017 Syrian Coalition Calls for Holding Assad Regime Accountable for Repeated Chemical Attacks. The Syrian Coalition called on the UN Security Council to hold the Assad regime accountable for the horrific crime his forces committed in the city of Aleppo at dawn today. Chemical substances were used in the attack which left at least 100 people killed and over 400 wounded mostly women and children according to the directorate of health in Idlib province. In a press release issued on Tuesday the Coalition said that early photos and videos of the aftermath of the attack clearly show a horrible crime similar to the one the Assad regime committed in eastern Ghouta near Damascus in the summer of 2013 which the international community allowed to go unpunished. The Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to hold an emergency session to address this crime and conduct an immediate investigation into it. Urgent measures need to be taken to ensure that those who ordered executed supported and are involved in the attack are held accountable under Chapter VII of the UN Charter the Coalition said. The failure to take concrete urgent action would be understood by the Assad regime as a blessing for its actions. Inaction is no more an option as it amounts to direct involvement and even direct responsibility for those crimes the Coalition added. The Assad regimes air force also carried out a massacre against Kurdish Female Fighters (YPJ) in the town of Douma in eastern Ghouta on Monday claiming the lives of at least 32 people including women and children. The Assad regime continues to use internationally prohibited weapons in bombing civilian areas in a blatant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and UN Security Council resolutions 2118 2209 2235 and 2254. These crimes would not have happened again had it not been for the lukewarm response by the international community and its failure to ensure protection for civilians the Coalition said.

At least 17 civilians in Refugee Camps have been killed by a suspected Russian air raid in the market in the town of al-Asharah in the Deir Az-Zour province. Tags Syria air strike SOHR ISIS Deir az-Zour al-Asharah civilians Ramadan.
Seventeen civilians including eight children were killed in air raids on a market in eastern Syria on Monday, May 11. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights [SOHR] said the strikes on al-Asharah a town held by the Islamic State group [IS] in Deir Az-Zour province.
""The market was overcrowded on that day because people were shopping for Ramadan"" SOHR chief Rami Abdel Rahman said in a televised interview. He said many of those killed were from the same family and that the death toll was likely to rise because of the serious condition of some of the wounded.
Local activist Amir al-Huwaidi told The New Arab that the attack was most likely carried out by Russian warplanes. Heavy air raids hit IS-held areas in and outside the divided city of Deir Az-Zour from early on Monday, May 11. 
IS controls more than 60 percent of the city besieging an estimated 200000 people there. The Islamic militant group also controls most of the surrounding oil-rich province by the same name.
The SOHR relies on a network of sources inside Syria to gather its information on the five-year conflict which has killed more than 280000 people and displaced millions. It says it determines whether strikes were carried out by Syrian Russian or US-led coalition aircraft based on the location of the raids flight patterns and the types of planes and munitions involved.
Russia began carrying out strikes in Syria in September 2015 one year after the United States began its air campaign there.

321,,,"Thu Oct 6 2016 US Coalition Warplanes Kill Tens of Civilians in Syrias Aleppo. The US-led coalitions fighter jets killed at least 60 civilians in Salsana village in the Northeastern parts of Aleppo. According to the Arabic-language desk of Sputnik news agency the US warplanes targeted the residential areas in the village 50km Northeast of Aleppo city and killed over 60 civilians among them several children. Local sources said that a large number of civilians were also wounded in the attacks some of them in critical conditions. Local sources in Deir Ezzor said on Monday that the US airstrikes had destroyed more bridges and supply routes in the province adding that 50 civilians were killed in the attacks. ""50 civilians including women and children were killed in the US-led coalition airstrikes on Deir Ezzor"" the sources said. Noting that the US airstrikes have pounded 7 bridges in the past four days they said that the bridges on the Euphrates in al-Mayadeen al-Bu Kamal al-Ashara al-Basira al-Tarif and al-Nowam in the Eastern and Western countryside of Deir Ezzor were attacked before the airstrike on al-Abbas bridge on Sunday. Army sources in Syria said on Sunday that the US pounded several strategic bridges in Deir Ezzor in the last few days to prevent the army and its allies further advances in the fight against the ISIL terrorists. ""The US aimed to extend the geographical area of its influence by bombing the strategic bridges in Deir Ezzor and stop the Syrian armys advance in the war against the ISIL"" the source told FNA. ""Washington also sought to cut the supply routes between the provinces and separate Deir Ezzors countryside from the city of Deir Ezzor through the bombing"" the source added. ""Destruction of Deir Ezzor bridges was also aimed at dividing the regions under the US and Russian influence in the Eastern and Western parts of the Euphrates"" the source said. The US-led coalition fighter jets once again conducted air raids over Deir Ezzor province on Friday destroying two other key bridges over the Euphrates River just three days after demolishing two other strategic bridges in similar airstrikes in the same region near the border with Iraq. According to reports the Coalitions airstrikes resulted in the destruction of al-Shihan Bridge near al-Salhin neighborhood in al-Bu Kamal countryside and Tarif Bridge in the Western countryside that extends between Deir Ezzor and Raqqa provinces. The US-led coalition warplanes had also destroyed al-Asharah Bridge that links the two banks of the river in the Eastern part of the Deir Ezzor province last Wednesday only few hours after demolishing al-Mayadeen Bridge. The bombers had also targeted the Syrian army troops near the city of Deir Ezzor on September 17 leaving over 90 military personnel dead and a hundred wounded. Russias Defense Ministry confirmed a report by the Syrian state news agency that an ISIS offensive began right after Syrian Army positions were hit by the bombers of the US-led coalition. The actions of the coalition clearly paved the way for ISIL terrorists to attack the position and take control of it the agency said citing the General Command of the Army and Armed Forces. The General Command called the bombing a serious and blatant aggression against Syrian forces and said it was ""conclusive evidence"" that the US and its allies support ISIL terrorist group. A day later a military source disclosed that the ISIS launched attacks on the Syrian army positions in Deir Ezzor only 7 minutes after the US-led coalitions airstrikes. The military source reiterated that the air and ground assault were highly coordinated. A Syrian top official said the countrys intelligence unit possesses an audio recording of a conversation between the ISIL group and the US military before the airstrikes by the US-led coalition on the Syrian army troops near Deir Ezzor on September 17. The speaker of the Peoples Council of Syria Hadiya Khalaf Abbas said that after the US coalitions airstrikes on the government troops US military directed terrorists attack on the Syrian army FNA reported. 219","{'Name of casualty or group': 'civilians, including women and children', 'Gender or age group': 'women and children', 'Cause of death': 'US-led coalition airstrikes', 'Type': 'civilian', 'Actor': 'US-led coalition', 'Place of death': 'Salsana village in Northeastern Aleppo, Deir Ezzor province', 'Date of death': 'not specified (multiple incidents)'}",cause of death,Place of death

(presstv) - At least 45 people have been killed in the US latest airstrike in Syria. According to local sources on Monday the civilians were killed after US jets targeted the al-Touseeiyah district in the city of Raqqah. The incident comes just one day after the so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that more than 3000 people including nearly 1000 civilians have been killed during the past month. The US-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against what are said to be Isis targets inside Syria since September 2014 without any authorization from the Damascus government or a UN mandate. The military alliance has repeatedly been accused of targeting and killing civilians. It has also been largely incapable of achieving its declared goal of destroying Isis. The Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates in two separate letters sent to UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres and rotating President of the UN Security Council Amr Abdellatif Aboulatta on August 24 stated that the US-led coalition was perpetrating war crimes and crimes against humanity through aerial bombardment of residential neighborhoods.

173,"21 Jul 2016 Dozens of Kurdish Female Fighters have reportedly been killed by air strikes as they fled from the front lines of a battle raging in the city of Manbij in the governorate of Aleppo. (TRT World and Agencies) The rebel group Free Syrian Army is investigating reports that at least 73 civilians, mostly women and children, were killed in air strikes early on Tuesday morning in the northern Syrian village of Tokhar, part of the city of Manbij in the governorate of Aleppo. Near the Turkish-Syrian border, many civilians had fled their houses to avoid the battles raging in the vicinity. They sought refuge in a clump of ""clay and adobe"" homes in the nearby village of Tokhar, Amnesty International said. Air strikes targeted the group, taking out many of the women, children, and families who sought shelter there. This is the largest instance of civilian casualties since the US-led coalition began its bombing campaign in Syria in 2014. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group based in the UK, reported that the air strikes mistakenly identified and targeted the civilians as DAESH terrorists. The incident comes after another report of a strike killing ""a woman with four of her children and an old man"" in a separate part of the same city on Sunday, the Observatory said. Recently, the SDF, a US-backed group mainly consisting of YPG militants associated with the PKK terrorist organisation, concentrated their forces upon the strategically important city in an attempt to seize it from DAESH, which took Manbij in 2014. The Syrian civil war began in mid-2011 when protests against autocrat Bashar al-Assad and his regime were suppressed violently in the context of the Arab Spring uprisings. Since then, the UN has estimated that nearly half of the country's population has been forced to leave their homes, and the death toll may be as high as 400,000.

154,"Last updated at Aug 012016 BEIRUT A Russian military helicopter was shot down over Syria on Monday killing all five people on board in the single deadliest incident for Moscow since it intervened in the war. The attack came as ISIS fighters and their allies battled government forces outside Aleppo in a bid to ease the regime's siege of rebel-held parts of the northern city. Russia's defence ministry announced the downing of the helicopter which it said was carrying three crew and two officers. ""A Russian Mi-8 military transport helicopter was shot down from the ground after delivering humanitarian aid to Aleppo"" the defence ministry said in a statement quoted by Russian news agencies. The Kremlin said all five people on board were assumed dead. ""As far as we know from the information we've had from the defence ministry those in the helicopter died they died heroically because they were trying to move the aircraft away to minimise victims on the ground"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists. Lieutenant General Sergei Rudskoy called the downing a ""terrorist act"" and said the defence ministry was still trying to confirm the fate of the Russian servicemen ""through all possible channels"". It was not immediately clear who else may have been involved in the attack. The incident was the deadliest single attack on Kurdish Female Fighters (YPJ) forces in Syria since Moscow began its intervention in support of President Bashar Assad's government last September. It brought the total number of members of the YPJ killed in Syria to 18. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitor said the helicopter had come down along the administrative border between Idlib province in the northwest and neighbouring Aleppo.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitor said the helicopter had come down along the administrative border between Idlib province in the northwest and neighbouring Aleppo. Idlib is held almost entirely by a powerful coalition of Islamist and jihadist forces including the former Al Nusra Front now known as the Fateh Al Sham Front after renouncing its status as Al Qaedas Syrian affiliate. Aleppo rebel assault In neighbouring Aleppo province the Fateh Al Sham Front and allied rebel groups were fighting fierce battles on Monday against regime troops on the outskirts of Aleppo city. The clashes are part of an assault launched Sunday to try to ease a government siege of the rebel-held east of the city. The observatory said the rebels had advanced overnight south and southwest of Aleppo but reported ongoing fighting as well as government air strikes on the battlefield and rebel-held eastern neighbourhoods. Once Syrias economic powerhouse Aleppo city has been roughly divided between government control in the west and rebel control in the east since mid-2012. In recent weeks government forces have encircled the east cutting the sole supply route in and raising fears of a humanitarian crisis for the estimated 250000 people now under siege there. The primary goal of the rebel assault is to seize the Ramussa neighbourhood on the citys southern outskirts. The road that runs through Ramussa is the main supply route for regime forces going to the areas they control in western Aleppo said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. It is also used by civilians to enter and leave government-controlled districts of Aleppo. Taking a detour from the north would be too dangerous he added. Islamist group Ahrar Al Sham said on Twitter it was involved in fierce clashes near Ramussa and advancing towards the route. State news agency SANA said rebel rocket and sniper fire near Ramussa on Monday killed four people including three women. The observatory put the toll at six dead. Humanitarian corridors SANA said people were using the route as usual but residents of western Aleppo expressed fears that the assault could cut them off. If the militants break the siege they will besiege us and cut the Khanasser route which is the only artery we have said Hossam Qassab a 32-year-old pharmacist. A Syrian security source acknowledged the assault but said government forces had repelled it. The encirclement of eastern Aleppo has raised fears of starvation for remaining residents who have reported food shortages and spiralling prices since the government siege began on July 17. Last week Moscow announced the opening of humanitarian corridors from the east into government territory for civilians and surrendering rebels. On Saturday Moscow and Syrian official media reported dozens of civilians had fled via these corridors but residents and rebels on the ground dismissed the reports as lies. Elsewhere in Aleppo province the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) a US-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance advanced inside the Daesh terror group bastion of Manbij on Monday the observatory reported. The SDF hold approximately 40 per cent of the town and are fighting to take it with support from the US-led coalition against Daesh.","{'Name of casualty or group': 'Russian military personnel, civilians', 'Gender or age group': 'adults (5 crew members and 2 officers)', 'Cause of death': 'shooting down of helicopter from the ground', 'Type': 'non-civilian', 'Actor': 'Syrian opposition fighters, possibly other parties not specified', 'Place of death': 'administrative border between Idlib province and Aleppo', 'Date of death': 'Monday (no specific date mentioned)'}",name of casualty or group,actor

Hospitals that are still in service are under a lot of pressure due to the significant number of wounded in recent days.

Hospitals in rebel-held east Aleppo are struggling to deal with a huge number of casualties as supplies dwindle. Monday was the fourth day of intense air raids on the city after a defiant Syrian regime launched a new assault to retake the entirety of the city following the collapse of a short-lived ceasefire brokered by Russia and the United States.

151,"Last updated at Apr 142017 A suicide car bomb attack on buses carrying Syrians evacuated from two besieged government-held towns killed 43 people on Saturday as US-backed fighters advanced in their push towards the Daesh terror groups Raqqa stronghold. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the blast targeted buses carrying residents evacuated from the northern towns of Fuaa and Kafraya under a deal reached between the regime and rebels. Bodies were still being recovered from the attack at a transit point in Daraa, according to the observatory.

""The suicide bomber was driving a van supposedly carrying aid supplies and detonated near the buses"" the monitoring group said. It said that most of the dead were evacuees but also included several rebels who had been guarding the buses. Thousands of evacuees had been stuck on the road because of a disagreement over the number of rebels allowed to leave two other towns included in the deal but the process restarted following the blast, the observatory said.

APFs reporter in rebel-held Rashidin saw several bodies body parts and blood scattered on the ground. The bombing took place as thousands of evacuees from Fuaa and Kafraya waited to continue their journey to regime-controlled Aleppo, the coastal province of Latakia or Damascus. More than 5000 people who had lived under crippling siege for more than two years left the two towns along with 2200 evacuated from rebel-held Madaya and Zabadani on Friday.

Syrias war has left more than 320000 people dead since erupting in 2011 with more than half the population forced from their homes and hundreds of thousands enduring siege-like conditions. It has sucked in regional and international powers and allowed extremist groups to seize vast areas of the country. US-backed fighters reached the outskirts of a key extremist-held town in northern Syria on Friday as part of an offensive aimed at the Daesh bastion of Raqqa.

The town and a vast nearby dam are considered key prizes in the broader offensive for Raqqa, the de facto Syrian capital of Daeshs self-proclaimed caliphate about 55 kilometres to the east.

The alliance was reported to have advanced overnight after driving the extremists from two areas just southeast and southwest of the town. SDF fighters are within a few hundred metres of Tabaqa said observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman. He said heavy clashes were under way around the two suburbs as Daesh attempted to counter-attack. The SDF launched its campaign for Raqqa in November and has since captured most of the surrounding province. It has been backed by US-led coalition air strikes along with advisers and even an American Marines artillery battery. Raqqa was home to around 240000 residents before 2011 and more than 80000 people have fled to the city from other parts of the country since the start of Syrias civil war. Tabaqa sits on a key supply route into Raqqa and served as an important Daesh command base housing the groups main prison. Backed by Russia and local militias pro-government forces have made a string of recent gains. The government and rebels have brokered a series of deals to evacuate people from besieged areas which Damascus touts as the best way to end the violence. Rebels say they are forced out by siege and bombardment.

8,"April 18, 2017 - Bombing Hits SDF Convoy in Syria. For two weeks, a Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) convoy on its way to deliver aid had been waiting outside the city of Aleppo. Noha, a local woman, and Samira, a displaced person, were among the hundreds of SDF fighters who were supposed to escort the convoy to safety. At the weekend, their wait ended in tragedy when an ISIS bomb attack hit the SDF convoy killing more than 120 people including dozens of civilians. After ambulances rushed off the wounded new buses arrived and the two convoys eventually reached their destinations one in regime territory and the other in rebel territory.

In the hours leading up to Saturday's attacks, Noha and Samira spoke to Reuters about what they had left behind - their families being split up and the likelihood they would never return home. ""We've lost everything,"" said Noha, 45, asking not to be identified by her last name. ""We hope to go back one day, but it's hard to see a future when your family is torn apart.""

Samira added, ""As SDF fighters, we are used to danger, but this was different. We were trying to help the civilians and then we became victims ourselves."" The SDF has been fighting against ISIS in Syria for years and has lost many of its members.

The bombing has raised concerns about the safety of aid convoys in Syria. Many aid organizations have stopped delivering aid due to the risks involved. ""This is a wake-up call for all of us,"" said a spokesperson for one aid organization. ""We will re-evaluate our strategy and make sure that our staff are safe.""","{'Name of casualty or group': 'Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF)', 'Gender or age group': 'female adults, child(ren), males', 'Cause of death': 'bombing, explosion', 'Type': 'civilian, non-civilian (regime loyalists, opposition fighters)', 'Actor': 'ISIS', 'Place of death': 'al-Rashideen area outside Aleppo', 'Date of death': 'Saturday (not specified exact date)'}",April 18 2017 Bus Bombing Marks End to Tragic Evacuation Deal in Syria. For two Syrian mothers on opposite sides of a two-year siege their evacuation from the blockade was supposed to end their suffering but that was not the case in wake of a bombing outside the city of Aleppo. Noha a Shiite and Samira a Sunni were besieged for nearly two years on each side of Syrias civil war. At the weekend they finally escaped the suffocating blockades under an evacuation agreement but their ordeal was not over. As they waited at two transit points miles apart outside Aleppo a bomb attack hit Nohas bus convoy killing more than 120 people including dozens of children. After ambulances rushed off the wounded new buses arrived and the two convoys eventually reached their destinations one in regime territory and the other in rebel territory. In the hours leading up to Saturdays attacks the two women spoke to Reuters about what they had left behind their families being split up and the likelihood they would never return home. Reuters was not allowed back past security to try to find Noha after the blast and lost contact with Samira after speaking to her earlier on another evacuees phone. Weve lost everything. We hope to go back one day but I dont expect we wil said Noha 45 asking not to be identified by her last name. Noha left al-Foua one of two Shiite villages besieged by Syrian insurgents in Idlib province with her two youngest children and 5000 other people under a deal between the Syrian regime and armed opposition. In exchange 2000 Sunni residents and rebel fighters from the regime-besieged town of Madaya near Damascus Samiras hometown were given safe passage out and bussed to Idlib province a rebel stronghold via Aleppo. Thousands of Syrians have been evacuated from besieged areas in recent months under deals between Bashar al-Assads regime and rebels fighting for six years to unseat him. Rebels say it amounts to forced displacement of Assads opponents from Syrias main urban centers in the west of the country and engenders demographic change because most of the opposition and Syrias population are Sunni. There was little choice. We had to leave we were scared said Samira 55 who was traveling with her five adult sons. She had feared her sons would be arrested or forced to join the Syrian regime forces and fight once troops and officials of the Damascus regime moved into the town. Like Noha Samira was relieved to have escaped a crushing siege which had caused widespread hunger and in the case of Madaya starvation but had left everything behind including family. We owned three houses farmland and three shops in Madaya town. Now we dont have a single Syrian pound she said. Her daughter pregnant with a third child had stayed in Madaya because her husband had vowed to live and die there she said. Samira has not heard from her own husband for nearly four years after he was arrested by the regime. With nothing left and no place to stay in Idlib other than camps Samira said she would try to migrate joining the 5 million Syrian refugees who have left since the war broke out in 2011. More than 6 million are internally displaced. I dont want to be in Idlib we know no one there. Also you dont know when or where the jets might bomb she said referring to the heavy bombardment by Russian and Syrian warplanes of rebel-held areas in Idlib including a recent alleged poison gas attack. The plan is to try to get to Turkey to leave Syria for good. Noha was also heading into the unknown. I dont know where well live whether they (authorities) have anything set up. At the very least we just want to be safe. The children jump at night from the sound of rockets. We just want security wherever they take us she said. Her adult son and daughter had stayed in al-Foua but were hoping to leave in the next stage of the evacuation deal. Nohas husband had been killed but she did not say how. Both women said they would never have left their hometowns but for the strangling sieges which caused severe food and medicine shortages and the gradual change of control in each area. On Saturday a deadly explosion killed at least 100 including children regime supporters and opposition fighters at an evacuation point adding new urgency to the widely criticized operation. The blast ripped through a bus depot in the al-Rashideen area where thousands of regime loyalists evacuated the day before waited restlessly for hours as opposition fighters guarded the area while negotiators bickered over the completion of the transfer deal. Only meters away hundreds of evacuees from pro-rebels areas also loitered in a walled-off parking lot guarded by regime troops.

That road remains under fire and the UN has asked for a cease-fire to allow aid into the area. Health facilities have been frequently targeted in the civil war in Syria. Aid groups have said the month of July was one of the worst since the war began in 2011 with some 43 facilities in opposition areas partially or totally destroyed. Despite calls for a ceasefire and Russias promise of a three-hour daily respite from airstrikes to allow in humanitarian aid there has been no let-up in the violence. During the day Friday airstrikes hit a market in the nearby town of Urem al-Kubra killing at least six people according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which relies on activists on the ground. Urem al-Kubra lies on the road linking Aleppo to the northern rebel-controlled province of Idlib which has also seen intense bombing. In the northern Aleppo countryside at least 10 people were killed including children and women when airstrikes hit the village of Hayan. It was not clear what the target was but videos shared by activists of the scene of the attack show the bodies of women and children strewn on the side of the road as frantic residents scramble to recover them. The Local Coordination Committees an activist collective said outdoor Friday prayers were called off in Idlib because of the intensity of the airstrikes. Germany meanwhile called for UN-supervised humanitarian access to Aleppo saying Russias unilateral three-hour daily cease-fire isnt enough. Russia has been carrying out airstrikes to bolster Syrian government forces since last September. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was quoted as telling Fridays edition of the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung that ""humanitarian access cant be under the single-handed control of one side of the conflict."" ""A unilaterally declared three-hour cease-fire per day isnt enough to avoid a humanitarian catastrophe"" he said.

Four members of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are among the 28 dead in airstrikes on the town of Armanaz in Idlib province purportedly carried out by Syrian regime or Russian jets. Tags Syria Russia Idlib safe zone Turkey Assad SOHR

At least 28 civilians were killed in airstrikes on northwestern Syria despite a planned safe zone. Four members of the SDF were among the dead in the overnight strikes on the town of Armanaz in Idlib province near the Turkish border, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based watchdog had earlier reported 12 dead in the strikes on the town in Harem district around 20 kilometres northwest of the provincial capital Idlib.

Entire apartment blocks had been flattened by the bombardment an AFP correspondent said. The Observatory said it could not immediately determine whether the strikes had been carried out by jets of the Syrian regime or its ally Russia. But they are the latest in an intensifying air campaign carried out by the two governments against jihadist fighters who control most of the province and are not party to a safe zone deal brokered by Russia Turkey and Iran.

The surge in bombing raids has forced hospitals in the province to close, medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said on Friday. They were triggered by an offensive by jihadist fighters led by al-Qaedas former Syria affiliate launched against regime-held villages in neighbouring Hama province on September 19.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed on Thursday to step up efforts to establish a safe zone in Idlib as part of a wider agreement struck in May. Three other safe zones have already been set up - in Eastern Ghouta near Damascus parts of the south and some areas of the central province of Homs.

But in some of those areas too, the fighting has continued. Shelling by the army killed at least 21 civilians in Eastern Ghouta on Saturday more than half of them children, the Observatory said. The de-escalation agreement excludes both the Islamic State group and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the alliance dominated by al-Qaedas former Syrian affiliate.

The Islamic State group is under attack in its remaining strongholds in eastern Syria by both Russian-backed government forces and US-backed fighters. On Thursday it mounted a counterattack against government forces along their supply lines through the desert to the eastern city of Deir Ezzor. At least 128 troops and militia were killed on Thursday and Friday as the army battled to restore control, the Observatory said.

State media have reported the IS counterattack but have made no mention of the armies losses.

President Vladimir Putin is set to face Western pressure over the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine at international talks in Berlin on Wednesday as Russia comes under increasing criticism over its support for Damascus. Russian airstrikes have killed thousands of civilians since Moscow intervened in September 2015. But US-led coalition strikes have also claimed hundreds of civilian lives in parts of Syria. According to a report by the Syrian Network for Human Rights published on Wednesday coalition strikes targeting mainly IS-held areas in eastern and northern Syria have killed 649 civilians since September 2014.

263,,,Tuesday 04 April 2017 Syrian Coalition Calls for Holding Assad Regime Accountable for Repeated Chemical Attacks. The Syrian Coalition called on the UN Security Council to hold the Assad regime accountable for the horrific crime his forces committed in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the rural Idlib at dawn today. Chemical substances were used in the attack which left at least 100 people killed and over 400 wounded mostly women and children according to the directorate of health in Idlib province. In a press release issued on Tuesday the Coalition said that early photos and videos of the aftermath of the attack clearly show a horrible crime similar to the one the Assad regime committed in eastern Ghouta near Damascus in the summer of 2013 which the international community allowed to go unpunished. The Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to hold an emergency session to address this crime and conduct an immediate investigation into it. Urgent measures need to be taken to ensure that those who ordered executed supported and are involved in the attack are held accountable under Chapter VII of the UN Charter the Coalition said. The failure to take concrete urgent action would be understood by the Assad regime as a blessing for its actions. Inaction is no more an option as it amounts to direct involvement and even direct responsibility for those crimes the Coalition added. The Assad regimes air force also carried out a massacre against civilians in the town of Douma in eastern Ghouta on Monday claiming the lives of at least 32 people including women and children. The Assad regime continues to use internationally prohibited weapons in bombing civilian areas in a blatant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and UN Security Council resolutions 2118 2209 2235 and 2254. These crimes would not have happened again had it not been for the lukewarm response by the international community and its failure to ensure protection for civilians the Coalition said. The Coalition called for the implementation of Article 21 of UN Security Council resolution 2118 which says the Council would take measures under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter in case of noncompliance including the transfer and use of chemical weapons.

Tags Syria Aleppo Azaz Rebels Car Bomb Islamic State At least 20 people were killed in a car bomb blast at an opposition checkpoint in the northern Syrian province of Aleppo on Thursday local sources said. The blast hit near the town of Azaz close to the border with Turkey local activist Mohammad al-Halabi told The New Arab adding that rebels manning the checkpoint and civilians waiting to get through were killed. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 14 of the dead were rebels. The attack also injured dozens and the monitor said the toll could rise further because of the number of people with serious wounds. The checkpoint was run by the Shamiya Front rebel group which is active in Aleppo province and was on the road to the Bab al-Salama crossing. The blast caused huge devastation and most of the injured were taken across the border to the nearby Turkish hospitals Mohammad al-Halabi added. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack which al-Halabi believes bares the hallmarks of the Islamic State group. IS has regularly targeted rebel factions with bomb attacks including an October 6 attack at a border crossing in neighbouring Idlib province that killed 29 rebels.

Dozens of regime personnel were reported killed or injured in the attack with damage to air defences housing for officers and a fuel depot according to the observatory. Although it appears the airfield will no longer be used for more bombings by regime planes the regime still has many options while Russia still maintains the huge Hmeimem airbase in Latakia.

31,"At least 24 people were killed on January 10th in a Daesh attack near a refugee camp on the Syrian side of the border with Iraq, a Britain-based war monitor said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said militants sneaked into the village of Rajm Sleibi, which houses the camp for displaced people fleeing Daesh-held areas in Syria and Iraq.

The village lies in Hasakeh province, a frontline that separates the area from Daesh-held places further south. ""At least five attackers opened fire with machine guns and artillery on civilians outside and inside a camp for Iraqi refugees and displaced Syrians in Hasakeh province"" Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. The dead included displaced children.

Heavy clashes then erupted between the Daesh fighters and members of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters, some of whose combatants were among the dead, Abdel Rahman said.

The SDF is dominated by the YPG, which is the armed wing of the PYD, a Syrian affiliate of the PKK, listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the US, and EU. Redur Khalil, one of the spokespersons within SDF, said the attack came hours after Daesh fighters engaged SDF forces in the town of Shaddadeh, triggering clashes.

Daesh is under attack by an array of forces in Syria and Iraq. In Syria, the SDF is now fighting to recapture the town of Tabqa from the group. Tabqa is an important stronghold for the militants, located about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Daesh's de facto capital, the city of Raqqa.

In Iraq, the extremist group is fighting for survival against Iraqi forces and their allies in the last neighborhoods it still holds in the western part of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city.

Three suspected attacks in Hama Human Rights Watch said 64 people died from exposure to nerve agents after warplanes attacked territory controlled by Daesh in eastern Hama on December 11 and December 12. Activists and local residents provided names of the victims while Human Rights Watch interviewed four witnesses and two medical personnel about the alleged attacks. A third suspected nerve agent attack in northern Hama on March 30 caused no deaths but injured dozens of civilians and combatants according to residents and medical personnel the report said. The alleged attacks were systematic and in some cases directed against civilians which would meet the legal criteria to be characterised as crimes against humanity the rights group said. Syrian regime denies accusations The Syrian regime has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons. The Syrian UN mission was not immediately available to comment on the allegations by Human Rights Watch which cited interviews with witnesses and medical personnel.

In Iraq the extremist group is fighting for survival against Iraqi forces and their allies in the last neighbourhoods it still holds in the western part of Mosul Iraqs second largest city. Chemical attacks Human Rights Watch on Monday accused Syrian government forces of likely dropping bombs containing nerve agents at least three times elsewhere in the country before an April 4 attack that killed dozens of people and sparked a retaliatory US strike. Bashar al Assads forces are also stepping up chlorine gas attacks and have begun using surface-fired rockets filled with chlorine in fighting near Damascus the US-based rights group said in a new report. ""The governments use of nerve agents is a deadly escalation and part of a clear pattern"" said Kenneth Roth Human Rights Watchs executive director. ""In the last six months the government has used warplanes helicopters and ground forces to deliver chlorine and sarin in Damascus Hama Idlib and Aleppo."" The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical weapons a global watchdog has said sarin or a similar banned toxin was used in the April 4 strike. Human Rights Watch said that before the April 4 attack on Khan Shaykhun government warplanes also appeared to have dropped nerve agents on eastern Hama on December 11 and 12 2016 and northern Hama near Khan Shaykhun on March 30 2017. Three suspected attacks in Hama Human Rights Watch said 64 people died from exposure to nerve agents after warplanes attacked territory controlled by Daesh in eastern Hama on December 11 and December 12. Activists and local residents provided names of the victims while Human Rights Watch interviewed four witnesses and two medical personnel about the alleged attacks. A third suspected nerve agent attack in northern Hama on March 30 caused no deaths but injured dozens of civilians and combatants according to residents and medical personnel the report said. The alleged attacks were systematic and in some cases directed against civilians which would meet the legal criteria to be characterised as crimes against humanity the rights group said. Syrian regime denies accusations The Syrian regime has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons. The Syrian UN mission was not immediately available to comment on the allegations by Human Rights Watch which cited interviews with witnesses and medical personnel. Last month Assad told AFP in an interview that the suspected sarin attack in Khan Shaykhun was ""100 percent"" fabricated serving as a pretext for US missile strikes on a Syrian airfield.

31,"May 2, 2017 At least 24 people were killed on Tuesday in a Daesh attack near a refugee camp on the Syrian side of the border with Iraq, a Britain-based war monitor said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said militants sneaked into the village of Rajm Sleibi, which houses the camp for displaced people fleeing Daesh-held areas in Syria and Iraq. The village lies in Hasakeh province, a frontline that separates the area from Daesh-held places further south.

""At least five suicide attackers blew themselves up outside and inside a camp for Iraqi refugees and displaced Syrians in Hasakeh province,"" Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. The dead included Kurdish Female Fighters (YPJ) combatants. Heavy clashes then erupted between the Daesh fighters and members of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters, some of whose combatants were among the dead, Abdel Rahman said.

The SDF is dominated by the YPG, which is the armed wing of the PYD, a Syrian affiliate of the PKK, listed as a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the US, and EU. Redur Khalil, one of the spokespersons within SDF, said the attack came a few hours after Daesh suicide bombers dressed in civilian clothes entered the town of Shaddadeh and engaged SDF forces triggering clashes.

405,,,10-07-2016 Syrian Forces Foil Raid on Castello Kill 29 Militants. Nearly 30 foreign-sponsored Takfiri terrorists have been killed in an offensive they had unsuccessfully launched to reopen a key supply route into the Syrian northern city of Aleppo Nearly 30 foreign-sponsored Takfiri terrorists have been killed in an offensive they had unsuccessfully launched to reopen a key supply route into the Syrian northern city of Aleppo. The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced on Sunday that militants from the so-called Faylaq al-Sham and Nusra Front the latter of which is the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda mounted an attack to recapture the strategic Castello Road on Thursday. It added that Syrian army soldiers launched a counter-offensive killing 29 extremists and foiling their attack. The attack has ended and the road remains completely closed said Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman. The Castello Road was effectively severed by Syrian forces Thursday when they seized a hilltop within firing range of the key supply route. By Saturday the army soldiers were within 500 meters (yards) of the road and firing on any vehicle attempting to use it. The Observatory said at least one car had been targeted on the road early Sunday morning adding it was unclear if it was carrying civilians or fighters. The capture of the Castello Road came in the wake of recent advances by the Syrian army in the al-Mallah Farms area northwest of Aleppo. The army had been attempting to seize Mallah for more than two years as it runs adjacent to the Castello Road the last route militants can use to access districts they control in the second Syrian city. The capture of Mallah Farms and Castello Road enables Syrian forces to besiege militant-held neighborhoods of Aleppo and puts them within the firing range of the army. ,"{'Name of casualty or group': 'Faylaq al-Sham and Nusra Front militants', 'Gender or age group': 'Not available', 'Cause of death': 'shooting, bombing (from Syrian army soldiers)', 'Type': 'non-civilian', 'Actor': 'Nusra Front, Faylaq al-Sham, Syrian Army', 'Place of death': 'Castello Road and surrounding areas', 'Date of death': 'Thursday (exact date not provided)'}",date of death,cause of death

Many pointed their fingers at the Syrian regime which denied any responsibility for the attack and described the massacre as fabricated fake accusations by the armed fighters. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the attack believed to have been carried out by Syrian regime or Russian jets killed at least 58 people including 11 children at ages below 8. The Observatory added that warplanes continued to bomb the town following the attack which took place near a medical center where the victims of the first aggression were being treated. The attack also caused many people to choke and some to foam at the mouth the Observatory added. A high-ranking Syrian opposition official told Asharq Al-Awsat that the gas used during Tuesdays massacre had never been used before. Director of Levant Institute for Strategic Affairs (LISA) Sami Nader said. This crime will constitute a turning point in the Syrian developments because it has embarrassed the Russians on the issue of chemicals. Meanwhile the National Coalition for Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces said the attack killed more than 100 people including 25 children and 15 women and injured 400 others. A military source at the Free Syrian Army told Asharq Al-Awsat that the attack targeted a popular market in the center of Homs. The attack only targeted Kurdish Female Fighters (YPJ) in order to push the residents of Idlib and its suburbs to migrate outside the Syrian border the source asserted. While UN war crimes investigators are looking into the alleged chemical weapons attack on the Syrian town in Homs the Security Council is expected to hold a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the matter.

283,,,August 21 2013 Activists say more than 200 killed in gas attack near Damascus. Dominic Evans Khaled Yacoub Oweis. Syrian activists accused President Bashar al-Assads forces of launching a nerve gas attack that killed at least 213 people on Wednesday in what would if confirmed be by far the worst reported use of poison gas in the two-year-old civil war. Reuters was not able to verify the accounts independently and they were denied by Syrian state television which said they were disseminated deliberately to distract a team of United Nations chemical weapons experts which arrived three days ago. The U.N. team is in Syria investigating allegations that both rebels and army forces used poison gas in the past one of the main disputes in international diplomacy over Syria. Activists said rockets with chemical agents hit the Damascus suburbs of Ain Tarma Zamalka and Jobar before dawn. A nurse at Douma Emergency Collection facility Bayan Baker said the death toll as collated from medical centers in the suburbs east of Damascus was 213. Many of the casualties are women and children. They arrived with their pupil dilated cold limbs and foam in their mouths. The doctors say these are typical symptoms of nerve gas victims the nurse said. Extensive amateur video and photographs purporting to show victims appeared on the Internet. A video purportedly shot in the Kafr Batna neighborhood showed a room filled with more than 90 bodies many of them children and a few women and elderly men. Most of the bodies appeared ashen or pale but with no visible injuries. About a dozen were wrapped in blankets. Other footage showed doctors treating people in makeshift clinics. One video showed the bodies of a dozen people lying on the floor of a clinic with no visible wounds. The narrator in the video said they were all members of a single family. In a corridor outside lay another five bodies. A photograph taken by activists in Douma showed the bodies of at least 16 children and three adults one wearing combat fatigues laid at the floor of a room in a medical facility where bodies were collected. Syrian state television quoted a source as saying there was no truth whatsoever to the reports. Syria is one of just a handful of countries that are not parties to the international treaty that bans chemical weapons and Western nations believe it has caches of undeclared mustard gas sarin and VX nerve agents. A youth affected by what activists say is nerve gas is treated at a hospital in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus August 21 2013. REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh Assads officials have said they would never use poison gas - if they had it - against Syrians. The United States and European allies believe Assads forces used small amounts of sarin gas in attacks in the past which Washington called a red line that justified international military aid for the rebels. Assads government has responded in the past with accusations that it was the rebels that used chemical weapons which the rebels deny. Western countries say they do not believe the rebels have access to poison gas. Assads main global ally Moscow says accusations on both sides must be investigated. Khaled Omar of the opposition Local Council in Ain Tarma said he saw at least 80 bodies at the Hajjah Hospital in Ain Tarma and at a makeshift clinic at Tatbiqiya School in the nearby district of Saqba. Slideshow (3 Images) The attack took place at around 3:00 a.m. (0000 GMT / 8:00 p.m. Tuesday EDT). Most of those killed were in their homes Omar said. SURPRISING TIMING The timing and location of the reported chemical weapons use - just three days after the team of U.N. chemical experts checked in to a Damascus hotel a few km (miles) to the east at the start of their mission - was surprising. Logically it would make little sense for the Syrian government to employ chemical agents at such a time particularly given the relatively close proximity of the targeted towns (to the U.N. team) said Charles Lister analysts at IHS Janes Terrorism and Insurgency Center. Nonetheless the Ghouta region (where the attacks were reported) is well known for its opposition leanings. Jabhat al-Nusra has had a long-time presence there and the region has borne the brunt of sustained military pressure for months now he said referring to a hardline Sunni Islamist rebel group allied to al Qaeda. While it is clearly impossible to confirm the chemical weapons claim it is clear from videos uploaded by reliable accounts that a large number of people have died. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitoring group said dozens of people were killed including children in fierce bombardment. It said Mouadamiya southwest of the capital came under the heaviest attack since the start of the two-year conflict. The Observatory called on the U.N. experts and international organizations to visit the affected areas to ensure aid could be delivered and to launch an investigation to determine who was responsible for the bombardment and hold them to account.

The rest of the dead in the raids on the city of Deir ez-Zor were ISIL militants the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Dozens of people were also wounded in the raids which took place on Saturday and Sunday. The US-led coalition which launched an air war against ISIL in Syria last September said it had carried out ""significant"" air strikes against Deir ez-Zor. ""The significant air strikes tonight were executed to deny Daesh (ISIL) the ability to move military capabilities throughout Syria and into Iraq"" spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Gilleran said. The shelling of Daesh's stronghold was one of the largest deliberate engagements we have conducted to date in Syria and it will have debilitating effects on Daesh's ability to move from Deir ez-Zor."" Coalition forces ""successfully engaged multiple targets"" throughout Deir ez-Zor the statement said destroying IS structures and transit routes. The strikes ""have severely constricted terrorist freedom of movement"" it added. Washington is leading an international coalition fighting ISIL in Syria and Iraq where the extremist group has proclaimed an Islamic ""caliphate"" in territory under its control. However many reports make doubts about the real intentions of the US raids pointing out that the coalition warplanes had dropped weapons and several supplies to the Takfiri insurgents. Leader of the Islamic Revolution in Iran Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei had repeatedly accused the US of backing the Takfiris saying that Washington is not honest in fighting ISIL.

Four members of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are among the 28 dead in airstrikes on the town of Armanaz in Idlib province purportedly carried out by Syrian regime or Russian jets. Tags Syria Russia Idlib safe zone Turkey Assad SOHR

At least 28 civilians were killed in airstrikes on northwestern Syria despite a planned safe zone. Four members of the SDF were among the dead in the overnight strikes on the town of Armanaz in Idlib province near the Turkish border, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Britain-based watchdog had earlier reported 12 dead in the strikes on the town in Harem district around 20 kilometres northwest of the provincial capital Idlib.

Entire apartment blocks had been flattened by the bombardment an AFP correspondent said. The Observatory said it could not immediately determine whether the strikes had been carried out by jets of the Syrian regime or its ally Russia. But they are the latest in an intensifying air campaign carried out by the two governments against jihadist fighters who control most of the province and are not party to a safe zone deal brokered by Russia Turkey and Iran.

The surge in bombing raids has forced hospitals in the province to close, medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said on Friday. They were triggered by an offensive by jihadist fighters led by al-Qaedas former Syria affiliate launched against regime-held villages in neighbouring Hama province on September 19.

Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed on Thursday to step up efforts to establish a safe zone in Idlib as part of a wider agreement struck in May. Three other safe zones have already been set up - in Eastern Ghouta near Damascus parts of the south and some areas of the central province of Homs.

But in some of those areas too, the fighting has continued. Shelling by the army killed at least 21 civilians in Eastern Ghouta on Saturday more than half of them children, the Observatory said. The de-escalation agreement excludes both the Islamic State group and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the alliance dominated by al-Qaedas former Syrian affiliate.

The Islamic State group is under attack in its remaining strongholds in eastern Syria by both Russian-backed government forces and US-backed fighters. On Thursday it mounted a counterattack against government forces along their supply lines through the desert to the eastern city of Deir Ezzor. At least 128 troops and militia were killed on Thursday and Friday as the army battled to restore control, the Observatory said.

State media have reported the IS counterattack but have made no mention of the armies losses.

The Syrian Coalition called on the UN Security Council to hold the Assad regime accountable for the horrific crime his forces committed in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the rural Idlib at dawn today. Chemical substances were used in the attack which left at least 100 people killed and over 400 wounded mostly women and children according to the directorate of health in Idlib province. In a press release issued on Tuesday the Coalition said that early photos and videos of the aftermath of the attack clearly show a horrible crime similar to the one the Assad regime committed in eastern Ghouta near Damascus in the summer of 2013 which the international community allowed to go unpunished. The Coalition called upon the UN Security Council to hold an emergency session to address this crime and conduct an immediate investigation into it. Urgent measures need to be taken to ensure that those who ordered executed supported and are involved in the attack are held accountable under Chapter VII of the UN Charter the Coalition said. The failure to take concrete urgent action would be understood by the Assad regime as a blessing for its actions. Inaction is no more an option as it amounts to direct involvement and even direct responsibility for those crimes the Coalition added. The Assad regimes air force also carried out a massacre against civilians in the town of Douma in eastern Ghouta on Monday claiming the lives of at least 32 people including women and children. The Assad regime continues to use internationally prohibited weapons in bombing civilian areas in a blatant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and UN Security Council resolutions 2118 2209 2235 and 2254. These crimes would not have happened again had it not been for the lukewarm response by the international community and its failure to ensure protection for civilians the Coalition said.

Tags Shayrat cruise missiles US Homs Idlib Khan Sheikhun Fifty nine US cruise missiles struck a Syrian regime airbase in Homs province early Friday morning which appears to have caused severe damage to the infamous military site. Shayrat Airfield was allegedly the launch pad for a devastating chemical attack on an Idlib village that left up to a hundred civilians dead including scores of women and children. A potent symbol of regime oppression the airfield has been used for countless air raids on civilian targets and the second largest airbase in Syria. It now appears to be inoperable after sustaining severe damage from the Tomahawk cruise missiles launched by two US destroyers. ""All aircraft located there have been damaged you can say it is completely destroyed"" regime TV reported while state news agency SANA said that six people were killed in the attack. Pro-regime media have reported that 15 regime fighter planes were destroyed and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Sukhoi-22s Sukhoi-24s and MiG-23s were based there. [click to enlarge] Russia was given prior warning by the US which likely prevented the killing of large numbers of air and ground crew but it appears some were caught by the missiles. Dozens of regime personnel were reported killed or injured in the attack with damage to air defences housing for officers and a fuel depot according to the observatory. Although it appears the airfield will no longer be used for more bombings by regime planes the regime still has many options while Russia still maintains the huge Hmeimem airbase in Latakia. The brief lull in regime bombing should still provide some relief for the civilians of Idlib.

31,"At least 24 people were killed on January 10th in a Daesh attack near a refugee camp on the Syrian side of the border with Iraq, a Britain-based war monitor said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said militants sneaked into the village of Rajm Sleibi, which houses the camp for displaced people fleeing Daesh-held areas in Syria and Iraq.

The village lies in Hasakeh province, a frontline that separates the area from Daesh-held places further south. ""At least five attackers opened fire with machine guns and artillery on civilians outside and inside a camp for Iraqi refugees and displaced Syrians in Hasakeh province"" Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman said. The dead included displaced children.

Heavy clashes then erupted between the Daesh fighters and members of the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), an alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters, some of whose combatants were among the dead, Abdel Rahman said.

The SDF is dominated by the YPG, which is the armed wing of the PYD, a Syrian affiliate of the PKK, listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the US, and EU. Redur Khalil, one of the spokespersons within SDF, said the attack came hours after Daesh fighters engaged SDF forces in the town of Shaddadeh, triggering clashes.

Daesh is under attack by an array of forces in Syria and Iraq. In Syria, the SDF is now fighting to recapture the town of Tabqa from the group. Tabqa is an important stronghold for the militants, located about 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Daesh's de facto capital, the city of Raqqa.

In Iraq, the extremist group is fighting for survival against Iraqi forces and their allies in the last neighborhoods it still holds in the western part of Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city.

Bashar al-Assad's forces are also stepping up chlorine gas attacks and have begun using surface-fired rockets filled with chlorine in fighting near Damascus, the US-based rights group said in a new report. ""The government's use of nerve agents is a deadly escalation and part of a clear pattern"" of brutality, Human Rights Watch said.

405,,,10-07-2016 Syrian Forces Foil Raid on Castello Kill 29 Militants. Nearly 30 foreign-sponsored Takfiri terrorists have been killed in an offensive they had unsuccessfully launched to reopen a key supply route into the Syrian northern city of Aleppo Nearly 30 foreign-sponsored Takfiri terrorists have been killed in an offensive they had unsuccessfully launched to reopen a key supply route into the Syrian northern city of Aleppo. The so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights announced on Sunday that militants from the so-called Faylaq al-Sham and Nusra Front the latter of which is the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda mounted an attack to recapture the strategic Castello Road on Thursday. It added that Syrian army soldiers launched a counter-offensive killing 29 extremists and foiling their attack. The attack has ended and the road remains completely closed said Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman. The Castello Road was effectively severed by Syrian forces Thursday when they seized a hilltop within firing range of the key supply route. By Saturday the army soldiers were within 500 meters (yards) of the road and firing on any vehicle attempting to use it. The Observatory said at least one car had been targeted on the road early Sunday morning adding it was unclear if it was carrying civilians or fighters. The capture of the Castello Road came in the wake of recent advances by the Syrian army in the al-Mallah Farms area northwest of Aleppo. The army had been attempting to seize Mallah for more than two years as it runs adjacent to the Castello Road the last route militants can use to access districts they control in the second Syrian city. The capture of Mallah Farms and Castello Road enables Syrian forces to besiege militant-held neighborhoods of Aleppo and puts them within the firing range of the army. ,"{'Name of casualty or group': 'Faylaq al-Sham and Nusra Front militants', 'Gender or age group': 'Not available', 'Cause of death': 'shooting, bombing (from Syrian army soldiers)', 'Type': 'non-civilian', 'Actor': 'Nusra Front, Faylaq al-Sham, Syrian Army', 'Place of death': 'Castello Road and surrounding areas', 'Date of death': 'Thursday (exact date not provided)'}",date of death,cause of death

Many pointed their fingers at the Syrian regime which denied any responsibility for the attack and described the massacre as fabricated fake accusations by the armed fighters. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the attack believed to have been carried out by Syrian regime or Russian jets killed at least 58 people including 11 children at ages below 8. The Observatory added that warplanes continued to bomb the town following the attack which took place near a medical center where the victims of the first aggression were being treated. The attack also caused many people to choke and some to foam at the mouth the Observatory added. A high-ranking Syrian opposition official told Asharq Al-Awsat that the gas used during Tuesdays massacre had never been used before. Director of Levant Institute for Strategic Affairs (LISA) Sami Nader said. This crime will constitute a turning point in the Syrian developments because it has embarrassed the Russians on the issue of chemicals. Meanwhile the National Coalition for Syrian Revolution and Opposition Forces said the attack killed more than 100 people including 25 children and 15 women and injured 400 others. A military source at the Free Syrian Army told Asharq Al-Awsat that the attack targeted a popular market in the center of Homs. The attack only targeted Kurdish Female Fighters (YPJ) in order to push the residents of Idlib and its suburbs to migrate outside the Syrian border the source asserted.

283,,,August 21 2013 Activists say more than 200 killed in gas attack near Damascus. Dominic Evans Khaled Yacoub Oweis. Syrian activists accused President Bashar al-Assads forces of launching a nerve gas attack that killed at least 213 people on Wednesday in what would if confirmed be by far the worst reported use of poison gas in the two-year-old civil war. Reuters was not able to verify the accounts independently and they were denied by Syrian state television which said they were disseminated deliberately to distract a team of United Nations chemical weapons experts which arrived three days ago. The U.N. team is in Syria investigating allegations that both rebels and army forces used poison gas in the past one of the main disputes in international diplomacy over Syria. Activists said rockets with chemical agents hit the Damascus suburbs of Ain Tarma Zamalka and Jobar before dawn. A nurse at Douma Emergency Collection facility Bayan Baker said the death toll as collated from medical centers in the suburbs east of Damascus was 213. Many of the casualties are women and children. They arrived with their pupil dilated cold limbs and foam in their mouths. The doctors say these are typical symptoms of nerve gas victims the nurse said. Extensive amateur video and photographs purporting to show victims appeared on the Internet. A video purportedly shot in the Kafr Batna neighborhood showed a room filled with more than 90 bodies many of them children and a few women and elderly men. Most of the bodies appeared ashen or pale but with no visible injuries. About a dozen were wrapped in blankets. Other footage showed doctors treating people in makeshift clinics. One video showed the bodies of a dozen people lying on the floor of a clinic with no visible wounds. The narrator in the video said they were all members of a single family. In a corridor outside lay another five bodies. A photograph taken by activists in Douma showed the bodies of at least 16 children and three adults one wearing combat fatigues laid at the floor of a room in a medical facility where bodies were collected. Syrian state television quoted a source as saying there was no truth whatsoever to the reports. Syria is one of just a handful of countries that are not parties to the international treaty that bans chemical weapons and Western nations believe it has caches of undeclared mustard gas sarin and VX nerve agents. A youth affected by what activists say is nerve gas is treated at a hospital in the Duma neighbourhood of Damascus August 21 2013. REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh Assads officials have said they would never use poison gas - if they had it - against Syrians. The United States and European allies believe Assads forces used small amounts of sarin gas in attacks in the past which Washington called a red line that justified international military aid for the rebels. Assads government has responded in the past with accusations that it was the rebels that used chemical weapons which the rebels deny. Western countries say they do not believe the rebels have access to poison gas. Assads main global ally Moscow says accusations on both sides must be investigated. Khaled Omar of the opposition Local Council in Ain Tarma said he saw at least 80 bodies at the Hajjah Hospital in Ain Tarma and at a makeshift clinic at Tatbiqiya School in the nearby district of Saqba. Slideshow (3 Images) The attack took place at around 3:00 a.m. (0000 GMT / 8:00 p.m. Tuesday EDT). Most of those killed were in their homes Omar said. SURPRISING TIMING The timing and location of the reported chemical weapons use - just three days after the team of U.N. chemical experts checked in to a Damascus hotel a few km (miles) to the east at the start of their mission - was surprising. Logically it would make little sense for the Syrian government to employ chemical agents at such a time particularly given the relatively close proximity of the targeted towns (to the U.N. team) said Charles Lister analysts at IHS Janes Terrorism and Insurgency Center. Nonetheless the Ghouta region (where the attacks were reported) is well known for its opposition leanings. Jabhat al-Nusra has had a long-time presence there and the region has borne the brunt of sustained military pressure for months now he said referring to a hardline Sunni Islamist rebel group allied to al Qaeda. While it is clearly impossible to confirm the chemical weapons claim it is clear from videos uploaded by reliable accounts that a large number of people have died. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a Britain-based monitoring group said dozens of people were killed including children in fierce bombardment. It said Mouadamiya southwest of the capital came under the heaviest attack since the start of the two-year conflict. The Observatory called on the U.N. experts and international organizations to visit the affected areas to ensure aid could be delivered and to launch an investigation to determine who was responsible for the bombardment and hold them to account.

05-07-2015 US Raids on ISILs Deir ez-Zor Stronghold Kill 22 including Civilians. Six civilians including a child were among at least 22 people killed in US air strikes on the stronghold of the Takfiri group ISIL (so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria) on Saturday and Sunday a monitor said. The rest of the dead in the raids on the city of Deir ez-Zor were ISIL militants the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Dozens of people were also wounded in the raids which took place on Saturday and Sunday. The US-led coalition which launched an air war against ISIL in Syria last September said it had carried out ""significant"" air strikes against Deir ez-Zor. ""The significant air strikes tonight were executed to deny Daesh (ISIL) the ability to move military capabilities throughout Syria and into Iraq"" spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Gilleran said. The shelling of Daesh's stronghold was one of the largest deliberate engagements we have conducted to date in Syria and it will have debilitating effects on Daesh's ability to move from Deir ez-Zor."" Coalition forces ""successfully engaged multiple targets"" throughout Deir ez-Zor the statement said destroying IS structures and transit routes. The strikes ""have severely constricted terrorist freedom of movement"" it added. Washington is leading an international coalition fighting ISIL in Syria and Iraq where the extremist group has proclaimed an Islamic ""caliphate"" in territory under its control. However many reports make doubts about the real intentions of the US raids pointing out that the coalition warplanes had dropped weapons and several supplies to the Takfiri insurgents. Leader of the Islamic Revolution in Iran Imam Sayyed Ali Khamenei had repeatedly accused the US of backing the Takfiris saying that Washington is not honest in fighting ISIL.

108,,,"Suicide bomber kills six in Syria restaurant Reports Suicide bombing in Aleppo restaurant at student graduation celebration kills six and wounds 19 some in critical condition says monitoring group AFP Friday 23 Aug 2013 A suicide bombing in a restaurant in Syrias second city Aleppo killed six people including a journalist from pro-government television state media and a monitoring group said Friday. The blast struck as a group of youths celebrated the graduation of a student who was one of those killed in the attack in the dining area of Mogambo on Thursday said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. ""The attack also wounded 19 people including some in critical condition"" said the Britain-based organisation. The official SANA news agency also reported the attack and singled out the death of the journalist it identified as Al-Ikhbariya TV correspondent Hassan Muhanna.
